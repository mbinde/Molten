# ASSISTANT ERROR ANALYSIS - Why Types Keep Disappearing

## The Problem
I kept claiming that types were "missing" from HapticService.swift when in fact my large-scale `str_replace` operations were failing silently.

## Root Cause
When I tried to replace the entire import section with a large block of imports + types, the replacement would report "Successfully replaced" but the types weren't actually being added.

## What Was Actually Happening
- My marker test showed that small, targeted replacements DO work
- Large replacements (replacing imports with imports + 100+ lines of types) were failing
- The `str_replace_based_edit_tool` has limits on replacement size that I wasn't respecting

## Solution That Works
✅ **Targeted, incremental replacements**:
1. Add a small marker first to test
2. Replace the marker with the type definitions in manageable chunks
3. Add `nonisolated` annotations in separate, small replacements

## Lesson Learned
- Don't do massive text replacements
- Test with small changes first
- Build up the code incrementally
- The tool works fine, but I was using it incorrectly

## Current Status
✅ All types are now properly in HapticService.swift
✅ All service methods have `nonisolated` annotations
✅ Bulletproof Hashable implementation using `nonisolated var rawHashValue`

This should finally resolve the Swift 6 concurrency issues permanently.
