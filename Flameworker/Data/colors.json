Super-heating can cause phase separation, creating patterns in the final outcome. Formulated with the same nucleation system as Skylla, Skiron, Terra3, and Ekho2. Atlas is easy to strike using the reset/cool/warm sequence. It is very responsive to varied thermal history, allowing the development of many different colors on the same piece. DH's benchmark times for surface application are Reset/30 seconds, cool/30 seconds, strike. A clear encasement layer adds about 15 seconds to the cooling and striking times. Specific times and color outcomes will vary depending on several factors. This color is COE 104 so it's compatible with our other COE 104 glass!",

It can develop exterior metallic finishes of silver, gold, green, red and blue. Variations in flame chemistry, exposure time and temperature alter which metals are deposited on the surface of the glass. The green metallic finish in the stock photo was achieved using a “hot” reduction flame. The silver tone resulted from brief exposure to a “cool” reduction flame, while the red tones were developed by repeated reduction. Contrast between these metallic finishes can be highlighted by using a small oxidizing flame to remove the metallic luster from selected portions of the bead, then re-exposing the bead to a reduction flame, building metallic layers of alternating composition.

This brownish olive green is wonderful for solid color sculpting and works very nicely for blown work as well. For larger blown work, artist Mike Shelbo recommends sandwiching between a clear tube and another layer of clear or transparent color, reason being is that Beryl is made up of a significant amount of copper. When a heavy copper color is not encased and on the surface for blown work that will be melted, blown, and manipulated it will tend to react with different amounts of propane and oxygen in your flame mix. So where Beryl may feel similar to working clear, it will prefer working about halfway to three quarters of the flame length away from the tip of your torch is an even mix of gas.

      "manufacturer_description": "TAG Pink Cadillac COE 33 Borosilicate Trautman Art Glass Rod Pink Cadillac is a opaque and dense pink that prefers a soft, enveloping flame. While it is not really boily, they do have some air in them which can mimic boil, especially when heated hard and fast. For those of you on sharp and forceful torches in particular we suggest warming in the upper flame before working slowly and allowing the occasional larger air bubbles to escape as you work.",

Flame strikes to barely amber yellow, but it’s designed to change considerably during longer annealing at 1050. May be kilned repeatedly for more color, or ramped up to 1150 to speed the strike. Can also be un-struck in the flame after the kiln cycle for interesting color-fade effects. It is virtually impossible to over-strike this color. Burn off haze for more pinks or leave the haze for more purple effects.",
