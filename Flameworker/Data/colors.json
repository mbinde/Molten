Working Tip: Pre-heat in outer flame. Avoid rapid heating Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This very bright opaque yellow will stay true when drawn down to smaller cane sizes and will not transmit light unless the application of color is thinner than 2mm. This color works great in the neutral flame region and can handle all flame atmospheres for short amounts of time. Do not use a highly reducing flame or a very sharp hot flame without quick movement of the color; this will avoid any possibility of minor boil spots. The vibrancy of Acid Yellow Crayon is a wonderful backing to many Glass Alchemy transparent colors, also a very complimentary color to the other opaques, and desirable for murine applications as well. Encasement in clear is not necessary but can be used to increase yield on size of solid or blown work and allow for more intense working conditions.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ‚ÄúAndromeda is a transparent green sparkle that strikes when heated to a transparent amber that will continue to strike to a deep purple, if the layer of color is thick enough. In addition to the base color there is sparkle and silver that will fume the surface of the color as it gets worked. You can treat Andromeda similar to GA Triple Passion and use an intense, sharp flame to burn off the silver fume on the surface if you wish to show the brilliance of the sparkle in the finish of your piece. You can get a range of finishes with this color without encasement, depending on how long the color is worked and in what flame atmosphere. I have found that when encased in clear, Andromeda handles very well and the clear can often intensify the sparkle. If worked before encasement you can trap silver fuming off the color and have a milky blue ghostly veil over your sparkle green or purple. The sparkle flakes in Andromeda seem to reflect a rainbow of color, ending in gold. The color can be manipulated by twisting, compressing, layering and thinning the amount of color used and how it is worked into your piece, resulting in a number of finishing looks. When kiln striking the base color to shift into deeper colors try 1100 degrees Fahrenheit for short intervals of time until you see the desired results. Andromeda pairs well with GA Eclipse and GA Grape.‚Äù ‚Äì Mike Shelbo",

An over oxidizing sharp hot flame setting may scum or boil when repeatedly immersed into the fire. To best avoid unwanted effects, either work your piece in the middle of the length of your torch flame or pre-encase with clear. When Aquatic Carnival is on the surface you can repeatedly reduce in the torch flame to bring out an array of color and effects. Try rotating the area you want reduced until a soft orange glow (not molten) appears, then remove from flame and wait a moment to see the result. Reduction at the end of the creation process yields completely different results than a piece worked in a reduction flame the whole time it was made. Bursts and gradients of greens and blues on the top of the deep teal creates beautiful tones, very reminiscent of water and the play of light on the ocean.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Work in neutral flame to avoid reduction (red streaks). Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This is one of my favorite translucent WYSIWYG colors. This brownish olive green transparent is wonderful for solid color sculpting and works very nicely for blown work as well. For larger blown work, I recommend sandwiching between a clear tube and another layer of clear or transparent color, reason being that Beryl is made up of a significant amount of copper. When a heavy copper color is not encased and on the surface for blown work that will be melted, blown, and manipulated it will tend to react with different amounts of propane and oxygen in your flame mix. So where Beryl may feel similar to working clear, it will prefer working about halfway to three quarters of the flame length away from the tip of your torch in an even mix of gas. Heavy reduction or propane in the flame mix, very close to the tip of your torch, will react with the copper in the color causing different surface effects. A very natural tone for your color palette, Beryl will compliment many other Glass Alchemy colors and when standing alone should be given the opportunity for light to transmit through the color for best presentation.\" - Mike Shelbo",

It is popular because it flows together without transition lines, is very shiny and the surface does not easily reduce. Working Tip: Work this color hot using a neutral flame. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Following closely behind Glass Alchemy Black Blue in saturation, this dense translucent black is good for several applications with different results. When kept 3mm or thicker, Black Violet will transmit a true manganese purple and reflect back a dense black. This color works nicely as it melts easily and will smooth into itself without trace of where application overlaps. When drawn into thin stringers you can see the violet come out of the color, and when applied thin or blown thin, this color is a beautiful translucent shade of violet that could be described as a smoky purple.\" - Mike Shelbo",

If thinned out to a stringer or 4mm or less, the color becomes a lighter tint. With a higher refractive index, I use this color mostly as solid bits and thicker tubing sections. I found it to be quite optically clear and mostly air-free. If you are a fan of Brilliant Blue, then you will love this more transparent shade of bright cobalt. It can be exposed to many flame atmospheres and working conditions without any concern. I would not recommend an overly heavy propane flame for a long working time, but Blue Dream seems to be quite resilient to reduction issues other cobalt‚Äôs may have.

Treat it like a Crayon color. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This is the sparkle color of all sparkle colors. Glass Alchemy created this color for several reasons. It can be worked into and mixed with other colors to create your own new sparkle colors. Disco Sparkle can be worked without encasement for an extremely dense sparkle finish that is smooth to the touch but looks as though there is a textured surface. For a wide variety of uses, I melt and condense a rod of 7mm Disco Sparkle into smaller thicker sections and use a thin encasement of clear 3mm rod and redraw out to desired cane size, usually about 4mm. This leaves you with an easily workable and still very dense sparkle finish. Take the ratio of five inches of 7mm clear rod and a half inch of Disco Sparkle and mix thoroughly for the look of a light amount of sparkle needed to accent or encase another color. If you plan to blow Disco Sparkle out into thin bubbles make sure to encase in clear. Disco Sparkle can also handle encasement under thick clear.\" - Mike Shelbo",

An example of this is that the goblin head bead is coiled Dragon's Blood and while still transparent enough to let light transmit through, it strikes to the perfect deep ruby that is dark enough to seem opaque. When experimenting with Dragon's Blood I covered a point of one inch heavy wall clear tube with it and blew it out thin to achieve a lighter, brighter, perfect ruby. When sandwiched between clear layers and blown out you can see the color goes a long way and with the self striking quality of the glass, you are able to see what you can expect from different ratios of color to clear.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: This color can handle different flame atmospheres but as always, we recommend working in a neutral flame. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ‚ÄúEclipse is a dense, transparent black that can withstand long working hours and many flame atmospheres. It work smooth and melts into itself without a trace of layering. It is a bit stiffer than clear when blowing it out or drawing it down. Eclipse stringers are black down to 1mm when they appear to be a dense smoky transparent black. A 2mm or 3mm thick layer of Eclipse over any tubing is enough to create the appearance of a solid black colored tube; keeping the clear underneath helps core heat remain while you work and saves on color versus coiled solid color. Reheating as many times as you want and numerous or long hours of kiln cycles don't seem to be an issue with Eclipse. I used it inside and on the back of large marbles with great results. Basically it‚Äôs my new go to black. I use GA Raven all the time and now Eclipse will fill tons of those jobs where really long flame exposure time or atmosphere was previously an issue with how my black looked in the finish of the piece. Eclipse stays really black with a super gloss finish that makes it the best and most workable black I have tried in the color palette for today's lampworker.‚Äù ‚Äì Mike Shelbo",

Haterade can act as a tint over clear or color; you can also gather it up for thick lenses or colored tubing. When drawn down to a stringer, Haterade will be a very light green. The vibrancy of this color shows up in different ways when transmitting and reflecting natural light and the high refractive index on it helps the color to pop in certain shapes, similar to fiber optics or prisms.Haterade is able to hold up under all flame atmospheres and in long working times both on the torch and in the kiln.

As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975¬∞ F, Anneal at 1050¬∞ F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ‚ÄúGA Jackpot has large flakes of sparkle giving this transparent deep money green an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. Whether you stripe, coil, mash, layer, twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changing the ‚Äúlook‚Äù or finish. You can achieve a larger flake or sparkle when the rod is applied and worked in flat without much manipulation. This color is great for every application including solid work, with or without encasement. Hollow forms will yield a beautiful array of effects depending on the thickness in color layer. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Jackpot will be transparent yet still lend a lot of sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Jackpot is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result would be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant base color. At any time, a thin layer of clear over Jackpot will often \"brighten\" it up a bit and the encasement always helps amplify the sparkle while leaving your surface clean and crisp. Jackpot can be encased in thick clear for marbles and sculptures. Layer under other more transparent colors such as GA Double Passion and GA Brilliant Blue for wonderful results.‚Äù ‚Äì Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This rich color has a lot of potential for different finishes depending on whether you kiln strike and/or flame reduce. The base color is similar to GA Triple Passion, but moves into deep purples quickly. This color sometimes reminds me of a concord grape in the way that the light bursts and highlights of ghosty silver-blue appear over a deep warm purple. The purple will become darker and darker the longer it is worked and if your piece goes into the kiln and you still want a darker color, then strike at 1100 F for 15-20 minutes extra. You can always change the look of the top layer of Passion Extreme by blasting a sharp and hot flame onto the surface, immediately cutting through the silver build up and reversing the strike of the \"skin\" of the color. From there it's just in how you expose it to the flame or kiln that will determine the outcome of this wonderful color. Passion Extreme holds up well in blown and solid applications, and thin stringers hold color well. When sandwiched under clear more light blue fumey effects are showcased over the base color. I really like using this color with GA Raven and on top of GA Sno White in a veiled cane.\" - Mike Shelbo",

A variety of effects are achievable depending on how long you flame/kiln strike. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo:\"This wonderful fusion of color could almost be called a ruby Triple Passion. The striking properties range from rubies to purples and blues, yellows and greens. While working the piece you will see continuous color shifts and you should consider how thick your color application is and at what point you would like the color to stop changing. For example, increased kiln time and temp will strike out the rubies and purples leaving you with a different looking piece that went in the kiln. The mixing of results that you will find as you work this color is just gorgeous. I find myself wanting to keep the array of pinks, oranges, rubies and yellows that earned the persimmon reference, but the light greens and blues that show up during the sculpting process compliment the other colors so well, a delicate balance of intense spot heating and reheating is needed to capture the whole range in one piece. I think that a quick annealing at 1030F is called for when you like the look of the piece going into the kiln. (If it is what you are going for and you do not want it to continue to strike get in and out of the kiln without a long hold.) This color is really fun and has moved into my top favorite Glass Alchemy color list.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Pre-heat in outer flame. Avoid rapid heating. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Red Crayon is an opaque 'what you see is what you get' (WYSIWYG). Working the color without encasement in the outer flame is ideal but quick passes in a sharp hot flame closer to your torch tip also works. Red Crayon works smooth and melts down without any potential sublimination if you have a bit of patience and keep from concentrating a sharp hot flame on one spot. It requires time to warm up and allow the heat to penetrate past the surface of the color. In other words think of your flame as a small brush and move lightly around the area you intend to get molten in a spot heat situation. This color works well for blown and sculptural work and murrine. When encased between two layers of clear glass you can blow out quite thin before color starts to become translucent. Use with Orange Crayon, Rasta Gold Crayon, Yellow Crayon, and Acid Yellow Crayon for recreating fire in sculpted and blown glass.\" - Mike Shelbo",

When drawn down to a stringer, Rozay will be a very light pink. The vibrancy of this color shows up in different ways when transmitting and reflecting natural light.

Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ‚ÄúWith large flakes of sparkle, this transparent deep brilliant blue has an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. If you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble. When the rod is applied and worked without much manipulation, it will show much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the ‚Äúlook‚Äù or finish. This color is great for every application including solid, with or without encasement, and hollow forms with varying thickness in color. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Sapphire will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Sapphire is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result will be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant blue base color.‚Äù ‚Äì Mike Shelbo",

With GA Shamrock being so saturated it lends well to all types of solid and blown work. It works very smoothly and melts without sublimation or any definition of the termination when separated from itself. While I have had success with encasement under a thick layer of clear, I still suggest testing and experimentation when using opaque greens to check if the application works in different circumstances. GA Shamrock pairs well with all other GA Crayon colors, I recommend GA Sno White and GA Rasta Gold. Try encasement of GA Shamrock with other opaques and transparent colors for a variety of different effects when drawn out thin or blown out to thinly veil the Shamrock. An example of this would be a light coating of GA Silver Strike-5 Frit and encasement with clear rod or frit to produce a natural toned effect with an earthy finish.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This transparent what you see is what you get is a warm brown, meaning it has tint of reddish amber to lighten up the color. Sienna is a cinnamon brown that can be predictable and the intensity can be controlled by thickness of color application. When drawing down into stringers you can encase solid clear or color with Sienna and achieve a very light tint, or in blown application get an extremely subtle tint by sandwiching in clear and blowing thin. Sienna handles just like GA Beryl or GA Cobalt 1, in the way that is holds heat well, melts into itself smoothly, and leaves no trace of where color was layered upon itself.

If desired, Sno White can be sandwiched between clear and blown out very thin and achieve a slightly translucent or milky finish. Without encasement in clear or another color you must work Sno White like other crayon colors and try to do most heating about an inch or so further out than where you work your clear glass. It can handle quick heats with an intense, hot and sharp flame, but do not overheat tiny areas and you will avoid bubbling.Sno White melts into itself smoothly and easily without trace of where color overlaps itself. For thick, solid sculpture work, I prefer to encase clear rod with Sno White so the core of the sculpture is more flexible and can hold core heat longer. Try encasing Sno White in every Glass Alchemy translucent color and find a whole new palette of colors that includes more pastels and can create a bold and vibrant look for your basic what you see is what you get colors.\" - Mike Shelbo",

You can remove the cloudiness with an intense spot heat, or let it build up to a slightly cream colored fume.

Working Tip: Work neutral to oxidizing for best results. A reducing flame will cause red streaking. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Tonic is a transparent blue, the color of an aquamarine gem. The color becomes more vibrant and its higher refractive index shows when used with itself in applications that allow the Tonic layer to be as thick as possible. When used as tubing, applied on clear or as coiled color, if the Tonic will be exposed to a lot of different working flames and long times in and out of the kiln, I advise a thin clear coat to protect the surface from overworking. Too much propane in your flame can result in a copper reduction leaving you with red streaks or patches on the surface of the un-encased Tonic. Too much over oxidizing can leave you with a surface haze or scuzz that must be swiped to remove. I often recommend a thin layer of clear frit over Tonic or evenly coated clear rod over your entire prep. I have used Tonic without encasement many times on solid sculpture and had good results, but I have seen a warming or flashing flame haze up a section. Working Tonic in as close to a neutral flame and away from the face of your torch is wise and will get you the best results with the color. If you have worked Raindrop in the past, this color is very similar in working properties. My favorite application is to gather up rods into 18mm or thicker sections and sculpt them into figurines. This next generation transparent is definitely a must have to fill out the rainbow palette. It can be layered over other colors like white for a nice pastel, but will be a faint tint unless applied as a 5-7mm thick layer. The first impression Tonic made on me was the thought that it was the color of window glass or old soda bottles, both aqua blue colors that I have always been fond of.‚Äù ‚Äì Mike Shelbo",

This means that as your translucent base glass shifts from a golden yellow to amber and into purples and violets you will also see a reaction from the silver adding in blue and green and purple hues. To best understand how this will work as you make your piece, heat your color rod to a molten state, let it cool, then with a normal working flame heat for a second at a time and pause in between to watch results. The striking happens quickly and that is why short exposure increments will yield large differences. Encase with clear to trap luster and pearlescent qualities.

The density of the color will stay true to the color of the rod before manipulation but when blown, it can become a milky translucent and opalescent version of itself. This is best achieved by sandwiching between clear and blowing thin. Turquoise works creamy but the slightest bit stiffer than other opaques. Overworking the surface of the color when not encased in clear can lead to undesired surface texture and finish. However, when desired you can use a reduction flame with heavy propane on unencased Turquoise before you put your piece in the annealer to bring out the copper, which will result in very natural toned red tints and streaks interacting with your base color.\" - Mike Shelbo",

It works great for sculpting solid work and for blown work. Twilight lends well to many styles of application.

Ruby K was developed to control the difficulties of striking copper rubies and allow maximum work time without livering. This allows the color to be used for lip wraps, layering, and sculptural applications without fear of over-striking. Work in a hot neutral to slightly oxidizing flame for best results. This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.",

This color‚Äôs a whole different beast in terms of its striking nature. I use in my solid work, pendants mostly. You don‚Äôt have to do much of anything to get the range of colors.
