//
//  DEPRECATED - This file has been replaced by AddPurchaseRecordView.swift
//  
//  The functionality from this file has been consolidated into AddPurchaseRecordView.swift
//  which uses the unified form components and error handling.
//
//  This file should be removed from the project.
//

// This file intentionally left empty to prevent compilation conflicts.
// Use AddPurchaseRecordView.swift instead, which provides the same functionality
// with unified components and better error handling.
