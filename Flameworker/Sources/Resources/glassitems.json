We are pushing this color's boundaries, making it as dense as possible, while keeping it an acidic lemony yellow. If you want a more traditional yellow, try Yellow Crayon. Working Tip: Pre-heat in outer flame. Avoid rapid heating Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This very bright opaque yellow will stay true when drawn down to smaller cane sizes and will not transmit light unless the application of color is thinner than 2mm. This color works great in the neutral flame region and can handle all flame atmospheres for short amounts of time. Do not use a highly reducing flame or a very sharp hot flame without quick movement of the color; this will avoid any possibility of minor boil spots. The vibrancy of Acid Yellow Crayon is a wonderful backing to many Glass Alchemy transparent colors, also a very complimentary color to the other opaques, and desirable for murine applications as well. Encasement in clear is not necessary but can be used to increase yield on size of solid or blown work and allow for more intense working conditions.\" - Mike Shelbo",

I use it for murrine, solid sculpture, blown work on clear tubing or coil potted and with or without encasement in clear.

When blown extremely thin you can see slight translucent qualities and minuscule air bubbles, but this only shows when not encased and blown thinner than 1mm.

I usually work the glass in the center of the distance between my torch tip and the end of the flame (the neutral flame zone), leaving me with a deep reddish brown. Then when the piece is completed and ready to put away I will increase propane in the flame and flash the piece in and out of the fire to bring the metallic reduction to the surface. This has yielded metallic colors ranging from a shiny copper penny to a beautiful rainbow iridescence. You can also repeatedly kiln your finished piece at 1040F to 1100F to achieve a metallic effect, leaving a slight luster finish of blues and purples and sometimes cream and green on top of your underlying dense browns and reds. Amazon Bronze looks awesome without being encased or underneath clear or other transparent colors.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Encasement of the rod in clear will result in trapping pearlescent greens and blues and some golden oranges and cream yellows. Depending on working time and whether the piece is solid or blown, you will see a range of finishes and shifting of colors. In a neutral working atmosphere the silver will come to the surface when not encased in clear. Color ranging from dark blue to yellow green pastel will sometimes have streaks of cool colors on the surface. When your piece is done you can reduce lightly and watch the metallic finish emerge in golds, silvers, greens, bronzes and blues depending on color layer thickness and amount of reduction given.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Work neutral; reduce at end for metallic effects. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"The base glass for Amazon Night is a translucent dark green and it is fully packed with silver and other metals. I love to encase this color with clear on a piece that will be worked for a couple hours. Reheating the area of Amazon Night in different ways (ex: sharp intense spot heat, or all over) will change the results of the silver trying to emerge through the clear layer. Bursts, streaks, wisps and smooth gradients will appear in all colors of blues, greens, purples, and golden yellow.When working Amazon Night without encasement, make sure not to overwork in a reducing atmosphere or in an over oxidizing flame to avoid phase separation or scum. Work in as close to a neutral atmosphere as possible until just before putting the piece away, then increase propane in flame and pass piece through flame and watch a chrome like rainbow iridescence build up with different levels of exposure.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Work this color like you would Triple Passion or a similar striking color. Since this color also has chrome it in work it in a neutral flame and garage at 975\u00b0 F, Anneal at 1050\u00b0 F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cAndromeda is a transparent green sparkle that strikes when heated to a transparent amber that will continue to strike to a deep purple, if the layer of color is thick enough. In addition to the base color there is sparkle and silver that will fume the surface of the color as it gets worked. You can treat Andromeda similar to GA Triple Passion and use an intense, sharp flame to burn off the silver fume on the surface if you wish to show the brilliance of the sparkle in the finish of your piece. You can get a range of finishes with this color without encasement, depending on how long the color is worked and in what flame atmosphere. I have found that when encased in clear, Andromeda handles very well and the clear can often intensify the sparkle. If worked before encasement you can trap silver fuming off the color and have a milky blue ghostly veil over your sparkle green or purple. The sparkle flakes in Andromeda seem to reflect a rainbow of color, ending in gold. The color can be manipulated by twisting, compressing, layering and thinning the amount of color used and how it is worked into your piece, resulting in a number of finishing looks. When kiln striking the base color to shift into deeper colors try 1100 degrees Fahrenheit for short intervals of time until you see the desired results. Andromeda pairs well with GA Eclipse and GA Grape.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

An over oxidizing sharp hot flame setting may scum or boil when repeatedly immersed into the fire. To best avoid unwanted effects, either work your piece in the middle of the length of your torch flame or pre-encase with clear. When Aquatic Carnival is on the surface you can repeatedly reduce in the torch flame to bring out an array of color and effects. Try rotating the area you want reduced until a soft orange glow (not molten) appears, then remove from flame and wait a moment to see the result. Reduction at the end of the creation process yields completely different results than a piece worked in a reduction flame the whole time it was made. Bursts and gradients of greens and blues on the top of the deep teal creates beautiful tones, very reminiscent of water and the play of light on the ocean.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Work in neutral flame to avoid reduction (red streaks). Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This is one of my favorite translucent WYSIWYG colors. This brownish olive green transparent is wonderful for solid color sculpting and works very nicely for blown work as well. For larger blown work, I recommend sandwiching between a clear tube and another layer of clear or transparent color, reason being that Beryl is made up of a significant amount of copper. When a heavy copper color is not encased and on the surface for blown work that will be melted, blown, and manipulated it will tend to react with different amounts of propane and oxygen in your flame mix. So where Beryl may feel similar to working clear, it will prefer working about halfway to three quarters of the flame length away from the tip of your torch in an even mix of gas. Heavy reduction or propane in the flame mix, very close to the tip of your torch, will react with the copper in the color causing different surface effects. A very natural tone for your color palette, Beryl will compliment many other Glass Alchemy colors and when standing alone should be given the opportunity for light to transmit through the color for best presentation.\" - Mike Shelbo",

When kept 3mm or thicker, Black Violet will transmit a true manganese purple and reflect back a dense black. This color works nicely as it melts easily and will smooth into itself without trace of where application overlaps.

I found it to be quite optically clear and mostly air-free. If you are a fan of Brilliant Blue, then you will love this more transparent shade of bright cobalt. It can be exposed to many flame atmospheres and working conditions without any concern. I would not recommend an overly heavy propane flame for a long working time, but Blue Dream seems to be quite resilient to reduction issues other cobalt\u2019s may have.

It is said that Chartreuse is the most visible color to the human eye. I like that. I also like to use it with Glass Alchemy's Grape, 773 for a nice contrast.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Treat it like a Crayon color. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This is the sparkle color of all sparkle colors. Glass Alchemy created this color for several reasons. It can be worked into and mixed with other colors to create your own new sparkle colors. Disco Sparkle can be worked without encasement for an extremely dense sparkle finish that is smooth to the touch but looks as though there is a textured surface. For a wide variety of uses, I melt and condense a rod of 7mm Disco Sparkle into smaller thicker sections and use a thin encasement of clear 3mm rod and redraw out to desired cane size, usually about 4mm. This leaves you with an easily workable and still very dense sparkle finish. Take the ratio of five inches of 7mm clear rod and a half inch of Disco Sparkle and mix thoroughly for the look of a light amount of sparkle needed to accent or encase another color. If you plan to blow Disco Sparkle out into thin bubbles make sure to encase in clear. Disco Sparkle can also handle encasement under thick clear.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Striking a bit slower than its Triple counterpart, you can see more yellows, ambers, oranges and pinks. The amount of silver in the color allows you to have a surface buildup of wispy and cloudy bursts of light blues and cream colors that can be controlled by the amount of propane in your torch flame setting.

If you are looking for a less intense version to use in thicker applications, try Half Blood, 1933. Working Tip: This color will strike back as it cools. Dragon\u2019s Blood will strike to a deeper red in the flame or kiln Artist Description by Mike Shelbo:\"This is a color I have been waiting to get my hands on for some time. It is a self striking deep ruby that does not over strike or liver. Dragon's Blood can be used in all applications such as surface work, inside out, solid or hollow sculpture and can be diluted to different consistencies for a brighter ruby finish. An example of this is that the goblin head bead is coiled Dragon's Blood and while still transparent enough to let light transmit through, it strikes to the perfect deep ruby that is dark enough to seem opaque. When experimenting with Dragon's Blood I covered a point of one inch heavy wall clear tube with it and blew it out thin to achieve a lighter, brighter, perfect ruby. When sandwiched between clear layers and blown out you can see the color goes a long way and with the self striking quality of the glass, you are able to see what you can expect from different ratios of color to clear.\" - Mike Shelbo",

This color is a green tone, with enough color changing silver to allow organic shifts without overpowering the base green. If you like Amazon Night, then you will want to try out this tamed down option. Working Tip: Flame or kiln strike at 1075\u00b0F. Work neutral; reduce at end for metallic effects. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This color can be worked either unencased or encased. When working this color unencased I advise using a flame that has a bit more oxygen in the mix than your normal settings. This will allow you to use reduction properly at the end of the piece by increasing the amount of propane in your torch flame. Through reduction your transparent green base glass will push out colors ranging from creamy blues and greens to yellows, oranges, and purples to a metallic rainbow iridescence. Encasement of rod will yield softer tones over green depending on flame settings during the encasement process.\" - Mike Shelbo",

      "manufacturer_description": "Eclipse is our most popular, easy to use black. When pulled down thin, Eclipse maintains a smoky black color, versus purple, like Black Violet. Described by many as \u201cbullet proof\u201d, Eclipse does not contain any chrome, so graying and checking are not a major concern. If you need a more saturated black, check out Raven, 9749. Working Tip: This color can handle different flame atmospheres but as always, we recommend working in a neutral flame. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cEclipse is a dense, transparent black that can withstand long working hours and many flame atmospheres. It work smooth and melts into itself without a trace of layering. It is a bit stiffer than clear when blowing it out or drawing it down. Eclipse stringers are black down to 1mm when they appear to be a dense smoky transparent black. A 2mm or 3mm thick layer of Eclipse over any tubing is enough to create the appearance of a solid black colored tube; keeping the clear underneath helps core heat remain while you work and saves on color versus coiled solid color. Reheating as many times as you want and numerous or long hours of kiln cycles don't seem to be an issue with Eclipse. I used it inside and on the back of large marbles with great results. Basically it\u2019s my new go to black. I use GA Raven all the time and now Eclipse will fill tons of those jobs where really long flame exposure time or atmosphere was previously an issue with how my black looked in the finish of the piece. Eclipse stays really black with a super gloss finish that makes it the best and most workable black I have tried in the color palette for today's lampworker.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

I love Grape for coiling bubbles and making solid color tubing sections, also for solid sculpture and marble work. Grape is one of the only borosilicate colors available that works almost identically to clear glass in the way that it is smooth and creamy, melts easily, holds its heat very well and can be worked for very long amounts of time in the flame and kiln without any fatigue to the surface of the glass.

I have always been a fan of deep copper rubies and when GA Half Blood emerged I was excited to have a beautiful striking copper ruby that was more prone to staying vibrant and transparent than going dark or toward liver when worked for a long time. I have been able to get an array of finishes from different combinations of color layer thickness and kiln time and temperature. Half Blood works well in all hollow and solid applications and under deep encasement.

This color holds up well in encasement and can be mixed with other colors to create custom super sparkle colors! Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975\u00b0 F, Anneal at 1050\u00b0 F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cGA Jackpot has large flakes of sparkle giving this transparent deep money green an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. Whether you stripe, coil, mash, layer, twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changing the \u201clook\u201d or finish. You can achieve a larger flake or sparkle when the rod is applied and worked in flat without much manipulation. This color is great for every application including solid work, with or without encasement. Hollow forms will yield a beautiful array of effects depending on the thickness in color layer. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Jackpot will be transparent yet still lend a lot of sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Jackpot is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result would be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant base color. At any time, a thin layer of clear over Jackpot will often \"brighten\" it up a bit and the encasement always helps amplify the sparkle while leaving your surface clean and crisp. Jackpot can be encased in thick clear for marbles and sculptures. Layer under other more transparent colors such as GA Double Passion and GA Brilliant Blue for wonderful results.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

      "manufacturer_description": "Paparazzi, 4595 is a highly usable, stable sparkle. A translucent version of Jackpot, a little bit of sparkle goes a long way, so try layering this color. Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975\u00b0 F, Anneal at 1050\u00b0 F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"With sparkle flakes this big there are a lot of possibilities for the finish with GA Paparazzi. What I am referring to is the fact that if you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble and the tight satin like pattern that is formed. Another possible finish effect with GA Paparazzi is when the rod is applied and worked flat. Without much manipulation, you will see much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the \u201clook\u201d or finish. This color is great for every application including solid with or without encasement. Hollow forms with varying thickness in color layer will yield a beautiful array of effects. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Paparazzi will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finishing look. GA Paparazzi pairs elegantly with GA Half Blood.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This rich color has a lot of potential for different finishes depending on whether you kiln strike and/or flame reduce. The base color is similar to GA Triple Passion, but moves into deep purples quickly. This color sometimes reminds me of a concord grape in the way that the light bursts and highlights of ghosty silver-blue appear over a deep warm purple. The purple will become darker and darker the longer it is worked and if your piece goes into the kiln and you still want a darker color, then strike at 1100 F for 15-20 minutes extra. You can always change the look of the top layer of Passion Extreme by blasting a sharp and hot flame onto the surface, immediately cutting through the silver build up and reversing the strike of the \"skin\" of the color. From there it's just in how you expose it to the flame or kiln that will determine the outcome of this wonderful color. Passion Extreme holds up well in blown and solid applications, and thin stringers hold color well. When sandwiched under clear more light blue fumey effects are showcased over the base color. I really like using this color with GA Raven and on top of GA Sno White in a veiled cane.\" - Mike Shelbo",

A variety of effects are achievable depending on how long you flame/kiln strike. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo:\"This wonderful fusion of color could almost be called a ruby Triple Passion. The striking properties range from rubies to purples and blues, yellows and greens. While working the piece you will see continuous color shifts and you should consider how thick your color application is and at what point you would like the color to stop changing. For example, increased kiln time and temp will strike out the rubies and purples leaving you with a different looking piece that went in the kiln. The mixing of results that you will find as you work this color is just gorgeous. I find myself wanting to keep the array of pinks, oranges, rubies and yellows that earned the persimmon reference, but the light greens and blues that show up during the sculpting process compliment the other colors so well, a delicate balance of intense spot heating and reheating is needed to capture the whole range in one piece. I think that a quick annealing at 1030F is called for when you like the look of the piece going into the kiln. (If it is what you are going for and you do not want it to continue to strike get in and out of the kiln without a long hold.) This color is really fun and has moved into my top favorite Glass Alchemy color list.\" - Mike Shelbo",

A fresh addition to the boro color palette, Raindrop adds a crisp, eye-catching element to finished work. Working Tip: Work neutral to oxidizing for best results. A reducing flame will cause red streaking. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Raindrop is a clean and crisp vibrant transparent blue that can be described as a shade of aquamarine. This color works well hollow and solid, layered and on the surface. Raindrop will be stable when encased in clear and the color holds well after being blown out and stretched thin. Once the color layer thickness is below 2mm you have a very light tint. One of my favorite uses is to veil Raindrop over another light color to create pastel shades. When used in sculptural pieces that are exposed to extremely long working times, I recommend a thin encasement of clear over the Raindrop sections. It pairs well with the transparent palette from Glass Alchemy like Haterade, Blue Dream and Grape. \" - Mike Shelbo",

If you want a chrome free black, check out Eclipse, 9977. Eclipse is less saturated than Raven, but is a highly workable chrome free black. Working Tip: Work in neutral flame. If you flash heat in a reducing flame as you finish the project you can produce a look similar to the sheen of a raven's wing. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This super saturated opaque black is the answer to your need for thin stringer work and dense overlays that need to be black when blown out thin. It handles nice and smooth, also a bit stiffer than some other opaques but not by much. Raven can not be worked in heavy reduction for long periods of time without encasement. When used in a neutral flame in the correct region of the flame, this color will respond well and leave you with a beautiful finish. Treat Raven as you would other GA Crayon colors and you will get clean results.Great for backing marbles, deep encasement, inside out work, and stuff and puff techniques. I like using Raven with so many other Glass Alchemy colors, but my favorite combo is with Haterade for encalmo work.\" - Mike Shelbo",

It will hold up well in stringers and thin blown applications. When blown and stretched thin enough Really Teally will become translucent and allow light to pass through it. Really Teally can be used with or without encasement in clear. Building up solid sections for sculptural bits shows how well the color melts into itself and also how well it holds heat. Really Teally is workable in all flame settings and can handle intense spot heats without concern of sublimation or boil.

Working the color without encasement in the outer flame is ideal but quick passes in a sharp hot flame closer to your torch tip also works. Red Crayon works smooth and melts down without any potential sublimination if you have a bit of patience and keep from concentrating a sharp hot flame on one spot. It requires time to warm up and allow the heat to penetrate past the surface of the color. In other words think of your flame as a small brush and move lightly around the area you intend to get molten in a spot heat situation. This color works well for blown and sculptural work and murrine. When encased between two layers of clear glass you can blow out quite thin before color starts to become translucent.

When drawn down to a stringer, Rozay will be a very light pink. The vibrancy of this color shows up in different ways when transmitting and reflecting natural light. Its high refractive index helps the color \"pop\" in certain shapes, similar to fiber optics or prisms. Rozay is also able to hold up under all flame atmospheres and in long working times both on the torch and in the kiln.

Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cWith large flakes of sparkle, this transparent deep brilliant blue has an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. If you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble. When the rod is applied and worked without much manipulation, it will show much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the \u201clook\u201d or finish. This color is great for every application including solid, with or without encasement, and hollow forms with varying thickness in color. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Sapphire will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Sapphire is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result will be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant blue base color.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

It works very smoothly and melts without sublimation or any definition of the termination when separated from itself. While I have had success with encasement under a thick layer of clear, I still suggest testing and experimentation when using opaque greens to check if the application works in different circumstances. GA Shamrock pairs well with all other GA Crayon colors, I recommend GA Sno White and GA Rasta Gold. Try encasement of GA Shamrock with other opaques and transparent colors for a variety of different effects when drawn out thin or blown out to thinly veil the Shamrock. An example of this would be a light coating of GA Silver Strike-5 Frit and encasement with clear rod or frit to produce a natural toned effect with an earthy finish.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Sienna is a cinnamon brown that can be predictable and the intensity can be controlled by thickness of color application.

Made with Tin Oxide, the spelling of Sno is us getting geeky with a chemistry joke!Working Tip: Heat slowly to raise the core temperature. Once the heat base is established, this color can be worked very hot and any air bubbles that popped during the preheat will smooth out. Getting this color white hot will cause excessive gas release that can not be repaired and should therefore be avoided. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This opaque white crayon is highly saturated with color so that you can draw down to stringers or blow out thin and still have a solid white finish. If desired, Sno White can be sandwiched between clear and blown out very thin and achieve a slightly translucent or milky finish. Without encasement in clear or another color you must work Sno White like other crayon colors and try to do most heating about an inch or so further out than where you work your clear glass. It can handle quick heats with an intense, hot and sharp flame, but do not overheat tiny areas and you will avoid bubbling.Sno White melts into itself smoothly and easily without trace of where color overlaps itself. For thick, solid sculpture work, I prefer to encase clear rod with Sno White so the core of the sculpture is more flexible and can hold core heat longer. Try encasing Sno White in every Glass Alchemy translucent color and find a whole new palette of colors that includes more pastels and can create a bold and vibrant look for your basic what you see is what you get colors.\" - Mike Shelbo",

When working Starry Night you must keep the surface in mind as the silver will push out in a ghost blue transparent cloudiness. You can remove the cloudiness with an intense spot heat, or let it build up to a slightly cream colored fume. Either way, there are loads of sparkles and possibilities for swirling silver into your pieces. I found I liked putting a thick layer of Starry Night over a clear tube, melting it smooth, encasing it with 6mm clear rod and then melting that to either stretch down, or blow out thin. It traps the silver fume and gives a different look to the sparkle than when it is un-encased.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Work neutral to oxidizing for best results. A reducing flame will cause red streaking. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Tonic is a transparent blue, the color of an aquamarine gem. The color becomes more vibrant and its higher refractive index shows when used with itself in applications that allow the Tonic layer to be as thick as possible. When used as tubing, applied on clear or as coiled color, if the Tonic will be exposed to a lot of different working flames and long times in and out of the kiln, I advise a thin clear coat to protect the surface from overworking. Too much propane in your flame can result in a copper reduction leaving you with red streaks or patches on the surface of the un-encased Tonic. Too much over oxidizing can leave you with a surface haze or scuzz that must be swiped to remove. I often recommend a thin layer of clear frit over Tonic or evenly coated clear rod over your entire prep. I have used Tonic without encasement many times on solid sculpture and had good results, but I have seen a warming or flashing flame haze up a section. Working Tonic in as close to a neutral flame and away from the face of your torch is wise and will get you the best results with the color. If you have worked Raindrop in the past, this color is very similar in working properties. My favorite application is to gather up rods into 18mm or thicker sections and sculpt them into figurines. This next generation transparent is definitely a must have to fill out the rainbow palette. It can be layered over other colors like white for a nice pastel, but will be a faint tint unless applied as a 5-7mm thick layer. The first impression Tonic made on me was the thought that it was the color of window glass or old soda bottles, both aqua blue colors that I have always been fond of.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

Recognizing that this was an important color, we did several months of development work and were very pleased to introduce Black Walnut, 8475. A deep rich opaque brown, this color works well in many applications and has become an important part of our lineup. Working Tip: Work in neutral flame to avoid reduction (gray wisps). Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This color is a saturated what you see is what you get opaque deep brown. It works very nicely in all flame atmospheres and in both blown and solid work. It melts into itself easily and is great for detail applied by stringers and in larger applications. Walnut seems opaque but when blown thin or applied in very thin stringers it will show its translucent quality. It can be worked for long periods of time without encasement and with heavy manipulation. This is one of the staple colors in the earth toned palette Glass Alchemy has to offer.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Works like other crayon colors and prefers to be in the mid to outer region of the flame but can come close to the torch tip in quick passes and light repeated spot heats. The color density holds well in stringers, canework, and murrine. Blowing with Yellow Crayon works well with encasement or color on the surface of your piece and will stay dense until the color layer is blown thinner than 1mm.

To test the striking time, we make a small ball at the end of the rod to reset the color, hold it out of the flame for 60 seconds to allow it to cool, then put it back in the tip of the flame for 30 seconds to strike. Regular Clio will be a lovely cherry red at that point. Clio Light will be paler at the same timed test. Clio is a color-shifting, reducing glass. The colors will shift in different light sources. Once reset and/or reduced that color shift is altered. Based on based on test batches from 2008-2009; CL-361, CL-360, and NE-325.",

      "manufacturer_description": "Summary: Striking Glass. Description: SP-723/722 2019 test batches are technical opaque gold-pink glasses. Rhea + Oracle-White. Made without lead, selenium or arsenic. The hotter you work, harder you chill and longer you strike, the pinker it will be. Jed\u2019s video is here. Jed\u2019s Notes I\u2019ve been working with the SP-722/723. These are my observations. I\u2019d love to hear yours. These opaque pinks require a sequence very similar to our regular striking sequence but the Reset and Cooling stages are exaggerated. RESET* For these glasses a normal Reset (heating the glass until it is transparent) is inadequate to activate the gold. Beads made without the focused heating will remain white even after being struck. I\u2019ve been getting the glass extra hot, either during the initial gathering and/or with an additional, focused heat. In the initial gathering, I work it up in a hot flame, roasting it for a little while in a moderate-to-hot flame, then gathering it onto the mandrel. For an additional heat, I roast the bead for maybe ten seconds right in the hot spot of the flame. The glass does not have to get running-off-the-mandrel hot, but it\u2019s hot enough to move under gravity. If the core is nice and cool, the outer surface can be roasted without the bead moving. (*in the case of this opaque pink, the reset isn\u2019t actually resetting the gold, so much as activating the gold/nuclei system so that it can strike, but the process is exactly like a hot, exaggerated reset, so I\u2019m going to use that more familiar term) COOLING This glass requires an exaggerated cooling cycle. I\u2019ve been air-cooling beads for 60 seconds. The use of marvers, presses, and beadrollers significantly decreases the required cooling time. Once it\u2019s cooled enough, you may be able to see a faint pinkness develop. Beads that have been inadequately or inconsistently cooled will display a pink and white fade instead of a more consistent pink. STRIKE Strike lightly in the tip of the flame. 30 seconds of gentle heating seems to develop the color. Longer works too, just keep the bead temperature on the cool side. The color continues to develop a little in the annealer, evening out the color.",

I got incredible color with minimal effort, and it worked with every technique I tried. I\u2019m delighted \u2013 the only thing that would make me happier is if it was in production! LOVE IT! This glass is easy to get a wonderful luster by lightly striking in a reducing flame. I got a nice ruby color metallic with a few waves through the flame. Heavy reduction over reactive glasses gave a cream color that I didn\u2019t find appealing but the the striking is just delightful. I will have to get more of this soon.",

      "manufacturer_description": "Summary: Opaque Speckled Luster.. Description: OP-507, purple, opaque speckled luster. Sold at the ISGB Gathering 2012. Some customers have reported that their beads with OP-507 have cracked, others are not having a problem. Every pot of glass we make, including test batches and clears, are tested for compatibility against Effetre clear. Our tolerances are +/- 350 PSI, well below the safe limit of +/- 500 PSI. This means that any two of our glasses, even at opposite ends of our limits, could have a total strain of 700 PSI which is below the breaking point of 1,000 PSI. The OP-507 (dark purple speckled luster test batch) tested at -215 PSI, which is within our standards. When Ellen let us know that her beads had cracked using Zephyr we re-tested the OP-507 against a worst case scenario batch of Zephyr. This means we selected a batch of Zephyr with the highest positive PSI in order to test against a test batch with a negative PSI. The OP-507 and Zephyr (5.26.12) strain was -441 PSI, well within our combined tolerances of 700 PSI and below the breaking point of 1,000 PSI. For whatever reason, despite all of our testing, the OP-507 at -215 PSI is causing problems anyway. There are multiple solutions we can offer for this problem. 1. Contact us for a refund or replacement for the OP-507. 2. We can help you determine the best fitting Zephyr or Aether for OP-507 that is likely already in your studio. If you bought Zephyr or Aether from us, contact us to review the PSI of each of the batch dates you have and we can recommend the best fit. We keep records of what batch date we ship to you so, as long as you haven\u2019t mixed multiple orders together, we know what batch date(s) you have. 3. If you don\u2019t already have the best fitting Zephyr or Aether, put in an order requesting a batch date that is the best fit for OP-507.",

ONE OF MY FAVORITES I love this glass\u2026It give a whole new look to Ink Blue and other glass with the beautiful sheen it adds. This is my second time ordering it and will be sooo sad if it disappears. Keep making this one Please. OH SO PRETTY A wonderful reduction glass that also strikes slightly to give warm peach tones over white, and also gives a wonderful sheen when used over a darker base like ink blue. This glass can also take more heat than other reduction glass before getting the blue haze effect. Please DH, make this your next release!",

Texture in reduced paddle made with Jim Moore\u2019s hand stamp tool . Other paddle has been reduced and partially encased with Aether. The CE, KA and CL series of glasses have color shifting properties and display varied tonalities in different light sources. Incandescent light and sunlight produce purple, pink and ruby tones. Fluorescent lighting produces blue, green and amber tones. Additionally, these colors both self strike and luster altering the transmission spectrum of the glass. Many color outcomes are possible with this unique color chemistry. WOW CE-352 is gorgeous and very easy to work with. I hope you make it a DH regular. I tried it with Moretti medium transparent aqua under and the gold luster tones makes for a nice Carribean sea color shift. Also looks great all by itself, looks almost opalescent. MY GO-TO REDUCING GLASS I can\u2019t say much more tha what the other beadmakers said about CE-352 \u2013 I love this glass too and hope it makes it into the DH lineup! I especially like how it retains the flash (or strobe, as I call it) when encased. CE-352 The colors I am able to get out of this glass are amazing! The color can vary from a gold/honey to a deep red reminiscent of Kalypso. This is definitely my favorite DH glass! INCREDIBLE GLASS This glass is amazing! It is incredibly easy to strike, and gets a beautiful golden pink reduction luster. I created an account just to review this glass! SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL This glass is incredible! Absolutely one of my favorites. Easy to strike and such a beautiful gold. Please please please make this a standard. I loved that completely covering clear how gold it turns out, but the best was striping it around clear that not only gave me that lucious gold but brought out a light fuschia as well. This is by far one of my favorite glasses that I\u2019ve had the pleasure of using. Cannot imagine someone not loving this and not being able to sell beads made with this at a premium. Truly eye catching.",

I found when I tried to boil it, it wouldn't, went to clear...let it cool a bit and strike and you get light orange all the way back to translucent red.\" \u2013 Elasia \"It is a beautiful true red that doesn\u2019t turn orange. If you work it as a base color for awhile, it will turn opaque in the middle, appearing as if you had encased an opaque red with a transparent one.\" \u2013 Chris Molter \"Sangre is nice and easy to strike red, especially if not played with too much. The longer you work with the glass in the flame, the darker and more opaque it became. I did have two beads turn out to be an 'iodine orange'.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \"I love this color. It's the easiest striking red I've gotten the pleasure to play with. I've spent 15 + minutes trying to strike moretti or vetro transparent red, and with Sangre, just had to try one time! It also doesn't burn out easily.\" \u2013 Evil Glass \"Sangre is a wonderful striking red that strikes easily. A must for every beadmaker's palette! \u00a0Thinly over clear it glows and is crisp and bright over white.\" \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \"It is a truer red than most I have used. It also strikes more evenly, but can also overstrike and turn translucent, or run to clear when worked a long time. I found it very soft for a transparent color, which makes it a bit more difficult to work sculpturally. On the other hand, the softness of the glass made it easy to go back in and add texture/ detail, so that was some compensation in terms of its use sculpturally.\" \u2013 Elise Swope \"This red is really awesome. If you don't keep continuous heat on it it remains transparent. If you continually heat it, it goes opaque. Very cool.\" \u2013 Genea Crivello \"Sangre is a definite blood red, easy to strike, kind of translucent. I worked this a long time and it didn't burn like the Lauscha translucent red can do.\" \u2013 Kevan Aponte \"I really do like Sangre, it holds itself well to being abused, being placed in reduction and with reactive glasses with it.\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"Sangre is one of my favourite reds [apart from Maraschino] as it's fuss free, easy to strike and a gorgeous shade!\" \u2013 Trudi Doherty Testers were divided on whether or not Sangre & Oz make the perfect holiday red & green colors. \"That red certainly does pop. And it's [Oz] a nice bright green. But in my mind - holly leaves are darker, and berries darker and bluer.\" Read more at DragonJools blog . \u2013 Dwyn Tomlinson \"Messy Color has a great transparent red called Sangre, which is a true Christmas red.\" Read more at the Frantz Art Glass blog . \u2013 Patricia Frantz \"Yes! Festive enough for fairy lights!\" Read more about Sangre at Julie Fountain's blog . \u2013 Julie Fountain \"While I love Sangre, it has too many wonderfully interesting properties and variations to be a 'Perfect Christmas Red.'\" \u2013 Bonnie Polinski \"I love working with Sangre & Oz and worked correctly, they are the perfect Christmas colors. I have an issue with Sangre though. I cannot consistently work the glass to a true transparent when used as a base bead. I often have swirls or layers in the center of my bead that are opal or even opaque. If I heat the bead enough to 'burn' the color out and then strike it back to red, I don\u2019t strike it consistently to an even red. But compared to the Italian reds, Sangre works better and doesn\u2019t suffer from getting too much heat.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"I did find the Sangre was a much nicer Christmas red on larger beads; on smaller ones it seemed a bit washed out.\" \u2013 Donna Dorman \"Definitely Christmas colors. I don\u2019t usually make 'theme' beads, but if I were to make something for Christmas these colors look perfect.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"They are a good color combination for Christmas colors.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \"The problem with Sangre, in the context of it being a 'Christmas red,' is that it looks much more like 'Bloody Halloween red.' When the color separates out it looks like blood that has been separated into cells and serum, or whatever the proper medical terms are. It\u2019s a beautiful red, and, except when it does the separated-blood thing, is very much a pure, bright Christmas red.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"Sangre is the perfect Christmas red.\" \u2013 Elizabeth Long \"Yes, they're perfect! Sangre is the perfect shade and density of Santa red.\" \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"I do not believe that Sangre and Oz are indicative to Christmas \u2013 they are too dense, even for spacers.\" \u2013 Vonna Maslanka \"Sangre will probably be the best red and most true to Christmas Red.\" \u2013 Sue Stewart \"Yes, Sangre & Oz are dead on perfect.\" \u2013 Starleen Colon Some testers report that Sangre shifts in color depending on the type of lighting. \"Sangre, like most transparent reds, likes to be photographed in natural daylight or else it will look like it has a brownish tinge to it.\" Read more at Laura's blog . \u2013 Laura Sparling \"Sangre is my favorite red.

A true clear, transparent orange. I could throw away the other 2 or 3 rods of transparent oranges and replace them with Clockwork in a heartbeat. I got transparency\u2026crystal clear orange which is what I was hoping for. I either didn\u2019t get to translucent or past it.\" \u2013 Sue Stewart \u201cI never got Clockwork to strike to translucency, only semi-transparency.\" \u2013 Teri Yount \u201cI had a hard time getting Clockwork to strike consistently. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t get the orange to come up and it would remain transparent, but that was only about 15% of the time. I especially had trouble with striking after pressing.\" \u2013 Terri Budrow-Nelson \u201cIt was a little difficult to strike when working a small spacer after I had heated it to the point of losing its color. But once it started to strike, it happened very quickly. I work mainly with large focals and bringing out the translucency in them was very easy.\" \u2013 Chris Molter \u201cIt took me awhile to get the hang of striking Clockwork as it seemed to strike differently than other striking glass. I found that I would think it wasn\u2019t going to strike and put it in the blanket to move on and when it had cooled, it was a wonderful orange.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \u201cClockwork seems to stay more transparent if not over heated in intense heat while working. Shorter bursts of heating and allowing the bead to cool seem to keep it more transparent. If the color was lost, you can easily bring it back by letting the bead cool and then gently flashing it in and out of the flame until you see the color turn back to orange.\" \u2013 Genea Crivello \"I found that it stayed clear and not translucent. It is easy to strike, except for very thin applications.\" \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite able to strike it as transparent as I wanted, but I was pleased with the result nonetheless. On each of my beads the Clockwork was evenly translucent with no variation of color saturation. I noticed on several of Vonna\u2019s beads that she was able to achieve a wide range of color from yellow-orange to bright orange, and from transparent to opaque to opacify, she flashed her bead in and out of a reduction flame.\" \u2013 Bonnie Polinski \"I\u2019ve never quite gotten the hang of working with Clockwork. It\u2019s a bit more cantankerous for me to strike than other transparent oranges, especially if I\u2019m working with 3-4 beads on each mandrel.\" \u2013 Gloria Sevey \"Clockwork is just the most eye-popping orange ever. I LOVE it! There has just never been such a wonderful transparent/translucent orange in COE 104. I\u2019m obsessive for orange and this one is ALWAYS on my bench.\" \u2013 Lori Peterson Clockwork is stiffer or more \"crisp\" than other 104 transparent oranges. \"I love it. It is more crisp and doesn\u2019t spread out in organics like Moretti\u2019s transparent orange.\" \u2013 Chris Molter \"Clockwork is a beautiful orange that stays crisp and clean in twisties.

Peachy Perssimon Coral, or other darker orangy corals. It's a very rich, creamy color. I tend to work my beads for a long time, so I wasn't able to get the light peach color to work for me, but the dark orange color is nice just the same. I wanted to test if this color reacts with silver colors, and it does . . . the reaction is very similar to what I've experienced with other corals as well.\" \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"I love this colour. \u00a0I use a lot of Effetre coral and I'm really excited about using Phoenix instead. \u00a0I love the different tones, as shown in the pic of spacers.\" \u2013 Julie Fountain \"When you first melt the rod of Phoenix in the flame and make a bead, the bead cools off to a beige color. When you reintroduce the bead into the flame, it starts to take on color and the first color that develops is peach. The more you heat the bead as you are working on it, the darker the coral becomes. You can super heat Phoenix throughout the beadmaking process to bring back the beige-peach color, but it works easiest if you make simple beads and only strike it once. \u00a0It takes practice to control the striking process and it doesn't always go the way you think it should - but that's what's fun about beadmaking!\" \u2013 Patricia Frantz Testers report that Phoenix rods often look different from batch to batch, but once worked they are a consistent hue. \"Got a new batch of CiM Phoenix in - and the rods look distinctly greyer than the original - but it is not labelled as an 'Unique' - CiM - for 'odd lot.' Unusual for CiM to not put a new product number on the colour if it is going to be different. So I thought I'd try it anyway. And the verdict is: if you strike it - the two batches are virtually indistinguishable. But if you don't - they are quite different.\" Read more at DragonJools blog . \u2013 Dwyn Tomlinson Special thanks to Elasia, Genea Crivello-Knable, Julie Fountain, Dwyn Tomlinson, & Pat O'Brien for providing the photos in this section.",

I made some beads with the dark rod of Watermelon and very little light came through the glass and the color was unappealing to me. However, the dark rod of Chocolate is a very nice brown. With such a huge difference between rods, I think it\u2019s kind of a confusing sale if dark and light rods are presented as the same color.\" \u2013 Gloria Sevey Many testers reported that our cloudy transparents were prone to shockiness or breakage. **Please pre-warm / pre-anneal rods accordingly.** \"In general, I have found the Cloudy Transparent colours to be a bit shocky. For the most part, this was quite manageable and well worth the effort, at least for the colours I've tried so far.\" Read more at Melanie's blog . \u2013 Melanie Graham \"I experienced neither shockiness nor boiling with the cloudy transparents. I did use a cool flame though. I\u2019ve changed my method of introducing glass rods to the flame which reduces shocking considerably [almost non-existent unless there are holes in the rod]. I rotate the tip of my rod way above the flame for a short time and then slowly rotate it downward into the flame. It\u2019s usually starting to melt by that time. That said, not everyone uses this cautious of a method and might have rods being shocky because of being put into the flame when they\u2019re still cold.\" \u2013 Gloria Sevey \"In the new cloudy colors it does seem the thicker the rod the more saturated the color seems to be. I had zero issue with Heather, Morgan and Watermelon. However my beloved Pink Lemonade and Vintage Rose were super shocky even with kiln warming.\" \u2013 Michelle  Veizaga \"Heather is a little shocky so a little pre-warming and careful introduction to the flame is all that\u2019s needed. I\u2019ve not had a lot of luck as Heather layered over Effetre White cracked [probably thermal] and when I tried over CiM Peace I got all sorts of crazy cracks. I found Chocolate a bit shocky, certainly more so than Watermelon which surprised me since they are both cloudy transparents and made in the same way. However pre-warming the rod seemed to help and the shocky-ness certainly wouldn\u2019t put me off.\" \u2013 Heather Johnson \"I agree with the mostly-too-shocky.\" \u2013 Dwyn Tomlinson \"I made a clear base and encased with the cloudy transparents, but sadly the beads cracked.\" \u2013 Trudi Doherty \"I experienced micro cracks when combining several of the cloudy transparents with 96 COE frit.\" \u2013 Darlene Collette \"I didn\u2019t have any problems with the cloudy transparents! They weren\u2019t shocky or boiled, but I have to admit, that I work in a cold flame and very carefully to prevent any bad incident.\" \u2013 Claudia Eidenbenz \"I found them intolerably shocky.\" \u2013 Laurie Nessel \"I preheated all the testing rods in a Devardi rod warmer as it was particularly cold in the UK at that time and this is something I always do that time of year. By doing this I didn't experience any shockiness. I also used a very thin encasement of Effetre Superclear 006 before applying cloudy transparents as an encasement - no issues.\" \u2013 Juliette Mullett \"I found the cloudy transparents shocky, that they boiled easily in the flame which created micro bubbles on the surface of beads, and that under clear encasement some of them cracked.\" \u2013 Jolene Wolfe Some testers reported that our cloudy transparents were prone to boiling. \"I did find some cloudy transparents could boil if you worked them too hot. I like to work them cooler and with not too much oxygen in the flame.\" \u2013 Trudi Doherty \"I had no issues with any of the cloudy transparents apart from a little bubbling in 1 or 2 of them.\" \u2013 Juliette Mullett \"Another thing common to all of these colours [so far] is that they can be easy to boil, so you really have to watch your heat. This is true not only with fine stringer, but also when applying the glass from the rod to your bead. Work higher up in the flame and a bit cooler to avoid this problem.\" Read more at Melanie's blog . \u2013 Melanie Graham Testers were divided on whether or not they liked the wispy or streaky quality of the cloudy transparents. \"All but two of the new color strands sold and the two that didn\u2019t sell didn\u2019t get much attention [Chocolate and Heather, both cloudy transparents]. I think that maybe those cloudy transparents just didn\u2019t have enough zing to capture the mood hopes of this moment in time.\" \u2013 Gloria Sevey \"There are lots of straight transparents. I'd vote for more cloudy transparents. If the glass is wispy then you can use those qualities to your advantage when making beads.\" \u2013 Carol Ann Savage \"I loved the wispy/streaky quality, for me that was a big part of the attraction.\" \u2013 Trudi Doherty \"I think the wispy/streaky quality is great for certain designs, but it's not something I prefer.\" \u2013 Laurie Nessel \"I quite like the wispy quality, but I do like the more saturated streaks.\" \u2013 Heather Johnson \"Some of my studio mates were unhappy with the color saturation in the cloudy transparents, particularly when making blown beads.\" \u2013 Janet Evans \"I thought the wispiness was an upside. We have lots of solid colours and very few wispy ones. My opinion is that the wispiness is a plus and fills a gap.\" \u2013 Melanie Graham",

They are very similar to each other. Stone Ground has more yellow/brown tones, Opal Yellow has more yellow/orange tones.\" \u2013 Bonnie Polinski \"It might be a fair generalization to say that the Opal Yellow tends to look a little lighter. In terms of reactivity and 'cool effects' - both of them react strongly - the Stone Ground possibly more so - perhaps just as it is a little darker. I'd say they are pretty comparable.\" Read more and see comparison beads at DragonJools blog . \u2013 Dwyn Tomlinson \"Stone Ground gives more surface color variation when worked and it is a bit darker in general compared to Opal Yellow. I like the variation that I get from working Stone Ground on the surface. Opal Yellow stays a single color for me.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"Stone Ground is less yellowy, and less reactive. I don't use it in place of Opal Yellow.\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"I liked Stone Ground very much, but in comparing it to my current batch of Opal Yellow [which has the pink/peach center rings to the rods], I slightly preferred Opal Yellow. I found Cranberry Pink and rubino oro were \u00a0prettier on the Opal Yellow; they seemed to turn much darker on the Stone Ground, and the Stone Ground took on a beige tone when they were added.\" \u2013 Donna Dorman \"They\u2019re sort of siblings, somewhat the same but each holds its own pros and cons. The really \u2018good\u2019 Opal Yellow [pink rings inside] is more reactive than Stone Ground and has more colors to it. But the current Opal Yellow is a lot like Stone Ground.\" \u2013 Elasia \"I don\u2019t think of them as interchangeable colors. Each has its own unique qualities. Stone Ground makes a great base bead on which to decorate with other colors. It\u2019s so neutral it almost disappears. If kept in the fire for a prolonged period, Stone Ground develops a darker more aged looking appearance that is really beautiful. I use lots of stringer decoration on Stone Ground and was delighted to see my stringers becoming attached to the base glass with having to melt them in, and none of them have had any issues with popping off.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"This is my very favorite color and I love using it with rubino and also Da Vinci. It is very lovely etched. I am able to bring out some darker hues as well as some pinks when worked a long time in the flame. \u00a0I prefer Stone Ground over Opal Yellow.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \"Truthfully, I don\u2019t see them as being comparable at all. I use the Italian OY for its reactive properties, and I use Stone Ground as an organic-looking base color.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"I can't tell any difference. The color is nearly identical [if not identical] and it strikes the same.\" \u2013 Elizabeth Long \"Stone Ground melts so much nicer [my OY is really shocky] and it seems to be more reactive with silver colors. I also noticed that it turns brown rather quickly while working and ends up being darker than OY.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"I use these mostly with silver glass or silver foil and I think they act about the same.\" \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \"I like Stone Ground for organics and with silver glasses. It is a little browner than OY. Raku gets more color on OY than Stone Ground.\" \u2013 Pat O'Brien \"Stone Ground is very similar. I do like this earthy creamy yellow. I have not found it to react with silver foil in my tests.\" \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"Stone Ground seems richer to me - Opal Yellow is a little washed out.\" \u2013 Robin Aragon \"I love Stone Ground. It is a dead on match to Opal Yellow, yet easier to pull brownish hues from the glass with multiple striking in an ever so slight reduction flame.\" \u2013 Starleen Colon \"Opal Yellow cannot be worked as long in the flame like Stone Ground. When working with Stone Ground I can get from white hot to a beautiful golden strike, every time! So I am able to play more with Stone Ground than with Opal Yellow.\" \u2013 Vonna Maslanka Testers generally agreed that Stone Ground is easy to strike but difficult to reproduce the exact struck hues each time.

Celia Friedman's tumble etching recipe for Peacock Green: \"Put your beads, a drop of dishwashing soap, a handful of small glass beads, and a spoonful of silicon carbide grit in a lapidary canister, add enough water to cover that plus a bit more, and tumble for 2-3 hours. Time and grit rating will determine the finished product. 1000 grit for two hours gives a smooth, subtle frost with a pearly gloss coming through, while 800 or 600 will give rougher results. The extra beads should be small, and many sources suggest 3-4 mm, but if you are tumbling large-hole beads those will get stuck in them, so I use mostly 6 mm. Tumbling doesn't texture glass inside grooves or depressions, so unless you like the artistic effect of a partially etched bead, it works best with evenly rounded or perfectly flat beads. Because dimpled hole ends don't etch, I make my tumbling beads with flat ends and dremel down the edges later. NOTE: once you put silicon grit in a canister you can never, ever use it, or anything you put in it, for polishing metal.\" \u2013 Celia Friedman",

It's really nice to find a non reactive green!\u201d \u2013 Evil Glass \u201cElphaba is a very nice lime green that doesn't swallow dots such as Moretti white M204. It is also not mushy like moretti pea green. It looks almost identical to pea green without all of the hassles.\u201d \u2013 Genea Crivello \u201cA lime green that is not much different than M-212 pea green.\u201d \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood Some testers reported that Elphaba reduces to a brown or purple hue. \u201cWhen Elphaba is reduced, I get shades of browns, blues, and purples.\u201d \u2013 Elasia \"I used Elphaba with Kronos, and reduced, but Elphaba was unchanged.\u201d \u2013 Teri Yount \u201cWhen reduced, Elphaba gets a little darker \u2013 a bit on the brown side.\u201d \u2013 Chris Molter \u201cI tried reducing, I got nothing.\u201d \u2013 Evil Glass Several testers remarked that Elphaba is particularly excellent for use as floral vines. \u201cI used Elphaba with Moretti petroleum green which caused migration/ separation of the latter- a nice effect for vines & leaves.\u201d \u2013 Elise Swope \u201cElphaba is easy to work with and very adaptable for stringers complex or single color. Mixes well with other greens, both transparents and pastels. I used it with Effetre Petroleum Green along with numerous other greens for complex stringers for floral vines.\u201d \u2013 Sue Stewart \u201cThe first thing I noticed about Elphaba is that it is a bit firmer than Moretti pastel greens, making it a little easier to work with, especially when marving, pressing, and making twist cane with Elphaba and transparent colors. Wonderful for pulling leaf and vine cane!\u201d \u2013 Bonnie Polinski Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable, Lorraine Chandler, Elasia, Bonnie Polinski, and Jan Whitesel-Keeton for the photos in this section.",

      "manufacturer_description": "CiM Tester Feedback In general, testers agree that Mojito is unique to the 104 glass color palette though at first glance it appears to be similar to apple green. \"It is light and delicate, but I do believe there is no other color quite like it.\" \u2013 Serena Thomas \"At first I expected Mojito to be exactly the same as Effetre Pale Apple Green, but on comparison, they are very different. As you can see in the comparison pictures, Apple has more of a yellow-brown tint to it, while Mojito has more of a green-gray tint. Mojito is also darker/more saturated than Apple.\" \u2013 Bethany Lemasters \"I have never seen a colour like this glass before! It is stunning!\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"Mojito is a nice light transparent yellow-green. I didn\u2019t have another light green transparent to compare it to, so I used it in combination with an olive green in my colors. It is a very nice complimentary color to the olive. It could easily be used with greens or yellows.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton How does Mojito compare to Italian greens? \"Apple green had a lot of bubbles and just didn\u2019t look clean and crisp to me. Mojito came out absolutely perfect \u2013 no imperfections at all. Also, the colors are a bit different. Mojito just looks better \u2013 a cleaner color, slightly lighter, and just looks a lot more subtle.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"Mojito is somewhere in-between Apple and Kelp.\" \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"Mojito and apple green are quite similar, Mojito is stiffer though. I think I will use it for the same purposes as apple green, in spacers and when I want to encase something with very light green.\" \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \"Mojito has a bit more color than Apple Green. It\u2019s a slight difference but it makes a big difference if used to encase a bead or make stringer to apply as raised dots. I used Mojito as raised dots on Olive based beads and the color is really nice. The glass melted well and may be another possible transparent to use instead of clear when encasing beads.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"Pale Apple Green is a little lighter than Mojito. I also compared with Yellow Green and Kelp and noticed that Mojito is one of the more 'calmer' of the colors besides Kelp\u2014meaning that it has a much lower tendency to bubble while working it. I really like this pale green and think it makes a wonderful compliment to Olive and Slytherin.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"Working with Mojito is very comparable to working with Italian apple green. It seems to be greyer and not as sprightly of a color. I prefer the Italian color wise.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"Mojito seemed a bit paler than apple green, but very pretty.\" \u2013 Donna Dorman \"Apple green and Mojito are a dead on match.\" \u2013 Starleen Colon \"I would prefer Mojito myself over the Apple Green.\" \u2013 Sue Stewart Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable (x2), Serena Thomas, & Bethany Lemasters for providing the photos in this section.",

Work thin over white or clear, or pull into stringers. Not really a colour for single colour spacers!\" \u2013 Dwyn Tomlinson \"The intensity of this transparent colour makes the rods look virtually opaque.\" \u2013 Jolene Wolfe \"Slytherin is a great dense green. The color is wonderful over white. \u00a0I especially like this color etched.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton Slytherin was designed to be dense enough to make leaf/vine cane, but testers were divided on whether or not we were successful in this goal. \"I really like Slytherin! It really does hold its own in leaf cane. I will be suggesting this glass in my tree bead tutorial.\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"I like the idea of a dense green like Slytherin but not for twisties or leaf cane. It is the wrong tone or shade or something. I prefer to encase something like Olive or Commando in Oz for leaves or vines. \u00a0And I prefer Oz for twisties.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"I loved the stiffness of Slytherin, and it made wonderful twisties.\" \u2013 Donna Dorman \"I used Slytherin alone to make dots on the flowers in my Cranberry Pink bracelet [to the right]. \u00a0Even as a tiny dot it shows off its pretty dark green color. Any other transparent green would have faded out to nothing. I made several twisties with Slytherin paired with Leaky Pen and Rubino. \u00a0Really gorgeous results.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"Slytherin is wonderful in twisties. Have mixed it with other greens and some browns to add visual interest when pulling leaf cane, and it really holds up well. Doesn\u2019t get 'swallowed' by the other colors \u2013 it plays nicely with them all.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"Slytherin is really dense on its own as a bead or layered over a lighter color, but when I tried making vine cane [Peacock Green with Slytherin stripes] it lost a lot of its vibrancy and looks like a washed out brownish green.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"I like that it has plenty of yellow in the green and is not too jewel like. It seems more natural in shades that you can pull from it. I like using this deep transparent over Khaki for a nice medium shade for leaf cane. But I found that if I didn\u2019t liberally encase the Khaki, it was a little lighter than expected when pulled out.\" \u2013 Marcy Lamberson \"Made a twisty with 2 stripes each of Olive, Elphaba, Split Pea, and Adamantium on a barrel of Slytherin. A perfect twisty for vines.\" \u2013 Pat O'Brien \"To my surprise, Slytherin didn't work well for vine. It looks very dense in rod form, however when used it is not quite dark enough. I know, I know, it really shocked me.\" \u2013 Starleen Colon \"Slytherin is nice but transparent Sage would still be my first choice for vines/leaves. It\u2019s just a little darker/richer in my opinion.\" \u2013 Sue Stewart Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable, Jolene Wolfe, Gail Witt, Sue Stewart, &  Maija-Leena Autio for the photos in this section.",

It doesn't fade out when used with lighter opaques - like many of the dark transparents in 104 COE glasses tend to. I also love that Leaky Pen is not a color that is close to anything else in the same COE - it's a brand new shade.\" \u2013 Kandice  Seeber \u201cThis is my favorite of all Messy Colors. I love intense transparents that I can use layered over white to make encased beads. This color holds up to making designs over white.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cTo get the blue color to look anything but black, I found that I had to put it over another color. I liked it over both white and clear. When placed over a white core, the bead took on an opaque multi-toned midnight blue color. When placed over clear, the bead became more transparent.\u201d \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \u201cSilver glass loves Leaky Pen! It is very dense and needs to be thinned out by applying over a lighter color.\u201d \u2013 Janice Laster Some testers reported Leaky Pen \"boiling,\" \"scumming,\" or \"sparkling.\" \u201cLeaky Pen boiled probably once out of A LOT of rods.\u201d \u2013 Elasia \u201cLike most blue colors, I had to work it really cool, or it would boil. I had to take my time but the results were worth it!\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cSince I turned down my flame considerably, I don\u2019t seem to have a problem with boiling or scum.\u201d \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \u201cI think I have run across this issue with Leaky Pen, but to me, this is more of an issue of learning the techniques of working with CiM glass in general. I find that you need to warm CiM colors more carefully to avoid the cracking, boiling. Even though I have observed bubbling and frothing, I find it\u2019s from working the glass too hot. When I move it out a little further, the issue resolves. CiM seems to need to work just a smidgen \u2018cooler\u2019.\u201d \u2013 Jennifer Borek \u201cMy experience with Leaky Pen is that it likes to be treated on the gentle side, not using lots of heat. \u00a0I have found with Leaky Pen if it does boil, I can cool and gently re-heat and it will lose the bubbles/pitting.\u201d \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \u201cLeaky Pen has boiled for me and is somewhat temperamental at first, but it will settle down after it gets melted in the bead. Sometimes it is difficult to pull stringers because it boils, but I know once it gets on the bead or murrini gather, it'll smooth out.\u201d \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"It doesn't bubble, and melts very smoothly.\" \u2013 Kandice  Seeber \"If you are having problems with Leaky Pen, use an oxidizing flame. That will keep the sparklies down. The sparkle spots didn't affect my finished beads. They still have a nice smooth texture.\" \u2013 Genea Crivello \"I had great luck with Leaky Pen, but I worked in a cooler flame.\" \u2013 Donna Dorman Special thanks to Debora Cox, Teri Wathan, Kimberly Affleck, Elasia, Maija-Leena Autio,  Genea Crivello-Knable, & Carol Oliver for providing the photos in this section.",

Celia Friedman's tumble etching recipe for Halong Bay: \"Put your beads, a drop of dishwashing soap, a handful of small glass beads, and a spoonful of silicon carbide grit in a lapidary canister, add enough water to cover that plus a bit more, and tumble for 2-3 hours. Time and grit rating will determine the finished product. 1000 grit for two hours gives a smooth, subtle frost with a pearly gloss coming through, while 800 or 600 will give rougher results. The extra beads should be small, and many sources suggest 3-4 mm, but if you are tumbling large-hole beads those will get stuck in them, so I use mostly 6 mm. Tumbling doesn't texture glass inside grooves or depressions, so unless you like the artistic effect of a partially etched bead, it works best with evenly rounded or perfectly flat beads. Because dimpled hole ends don't etch, I make my tumbling beads with flat ends and dremel down the edges later. NOTE: once you put silicon grit in a canister you can never, ever use it, or anything you put in it, for polishing metal.\" \u2013 Celia Friedman",

Occasionally I will find them bubbling on the surface, but for me, keeping the glass a little higher in the flame works like a charm.\u201d \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"Pulsar boils a bit easier for me than the Italian aquas. Nice color, just a bit temperamental.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler Some testers reported problems with Pulsar pitting. \"Recently I had an issue with Pulsar & Azure pitting and bubbling when too much heat was applied. The hose and my equipment were relatively new, and there was nothing about the flame to suggest contamination, but when I switched out the hose the problem started going away. After a few hours of work, whatever contamination had been coming from my hose had flushed out of the torch head, and the glass behaved normally again.\" \u2013 Celia Friedman \"Like most dark blue transparents, Pulsar is sparky.

      "manufacturer_description": "CiM Tester Feedback Thai Orchid is a unique addition to the 104 lampworking palette. \u201cIt is a nice addition to the purple color palette in our industry. It\u2019s dark enough not to be brown and purple enough not to be red. It\u2019s PURPLE. A beautiful and very welcome addition to the purples that are already out there.\u201d \u2013 Sue Stewart \u201cA luscious orchid! Nothing in the Moretti palette to compare.\u201d \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \u201cA true opaque purple, without the problems that come with so many.\u201d \u2013 Elise Swope \u201cIt doesn't have a brown undertone! Yay! I made one bead with both colors...and you could really see the brown colors in the moretti purples, and not in the Thai Orchid.\u201d \u2013 Evil Glass \u201cIt\u2019s close to other 104 violets, but more intense, more purple. Better.\u201d \u2013 Terri Budrow-Nelson Thai Orchid is very dark. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to photograph! This color and Lapis are so dark they appear almost black in photos.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cThis one just stays purple. It is maybe on the dark side but it stays true to the rod color. It definitely is a WYSIWYG color as seems to be the case with the entire CiM line.\u201d \u2013 Sue Stewart Some testers reported a metallic sheen when reducing Thai Orchid. \"I noticed a metallic sheen when working too close to the torch head or when in a reduction flame.\u201d \u2013 Tina Lamasney \u201cI reduced it several times and didn\u2019t see any change.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cI fried, reduced, cooled, reduced and got no reaction.\u201d \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \u201cI didn\u2019t reduce much, but Vonna did. Thai Orchid began to acquire a silvered look in a reduction flame. Most of the silver look burned back off when I changed to a neutral or slight oxidizing flame.\u201d \u2013 Bonnie Polinski \u201cIt gets silver when worked for a long period of time.\u201d \u2013 Genea Crivello \u201cI noticed a metallic sheen when working, but it wasn't there when not hot.\u201d \u2013 Evil Glass We asked our testers to compare Grape Ape, Evil Queen, Poi, & Thai Orchid. \"I had a tough time with all of these purples because they all looked the same to me. Poi is lighter in color, but it is relatively close to Effetre violet, so then you have the price thing to consider. Evil Queen isn't a bad purple, but my complaint about it is just that it is too dark. Grape Ape striated a lot.\" \u2013 Bethany Lemasters \"All these purples look fairly similar when made into spacers. But I like Evil Queen because it is a slightly brighter purple. It\u2019s a toss-up between Poi and Thai Orchid because they both got great reactions when used over Hades, so I think they can do some neat effects.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"Poi is my favorite.\" \u2013 Sue Stewart \"Evil Queen is the best of the bunch even though it is expensive. Poi is my favorite when encased due to lines of deeper purple that develop. Thai Orchid is my favorite for pulling out a deep silver luster.\" \u2013 Starleen Colon \"For me, I find Grape Ape, Poi and Thai Orchid to be very similar in hue, but with different densities. They definitely have their place in the current palette of purples, but they are very similar. Evil Queen is a very nice medium purple and would get my vote for my favorite of the four. I think Evil Queen is a better neutral medium purple than the Italian colors.\" \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"Grape Ape sometimes has a dirty look to it. Evil Queen can work for flowers if put over Peace. Poi is kinda washed out looking. Thai Orchid is my favorite, dark and opaque.\" \u2013 Pat O'Brien \"Evil Queen seems too close to Moretti in a shade that is less interesting to me. I like Thai Orchid the best. It\u2019s a very rich, pure and dark purple that doesn\u2019t seem to have any gray or other colors in it.\" \u2013 Marcy Lamberson \"If I have to choose, I guess Grape Ape is my favorite because it seems to be the darkest.\" \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \"Evil Queen is hands-down my fav, but it costs quite a bit more, so I generally try to make use of one of the lower priced purples, usually Grape Ape.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"I love Grape Ape because it really is a grapey purple opaque. This color fills a hole in the glass palette. I definitely like Evil Queen the best as it is the most opaque. Poi has a lot of gray tone to it. Thai Orchid is my second favorite of the CiM purples. It\u2019s a bit on the grey side, but is nicely opaque and is easy to use. It melts well and makes a great base bead color.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"I like Evil Queen the best because it is a more true purple. The others have a touch of gray.\" \u2013 Elizabeth Long \"Grape Ape is my favorite. Evil Queen is equivalent to 272 violet to me but more purple than gray, and more lavender than Thai Orchid. Poi is a great purple, I like it. Thai Orchid is a true dark purple to me and I like the reactions with silver glasses.\" \u2013 Elasia \"To me, they are all virtually indistinguishable. I put them all side by side on mandrels, and even under an Ott light it was virtually impossible to see any differences. Two other lampworkers looked at the beads as well, and they saw no difference in them either. The only one a bit different was Evil Queen: it is slightly prettier, a bit purpleier, but considering it\u2019s over 3 times the price of Grape Ape, I don\u2019t see any way to justify the cost difference.\" \u2013 Donna Dorman \"Thai Orchid is my favorite - I just like the colour the best!\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"Grape Ape is one of my favorites. Love the color and how it works. Evil Queen is a favorite of some of my customers. Can\u2019t seem to make anything that I like with Poi. Love how Thai Orchid works but it does get a bit metallic at times.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"I really love Grape Ape. I also think it has nicer working properties [it's firmer and easier for me to work with] at the torch than E Violet. Grape Ape has a richer and deeper color saturation and does not seem to get as dirty as E Violet does. I also really love Thai Orchid because of the richness, depth, and tone of the color.\" \u2013 Bonnie Polinski Testers report that Thai Orchid color shifts depending on the type of lighting.

The photos on this page show a mix of both the original and new formulations. If you need further clarification about how Crocus works, please contact info@creationismessy.com. Crocus is unique to the 104 lampworking palette. \"Crocus is a bright, basically neon, purple. There are no other colors out there that even come close to Crocus in the purple department. In my experience, it keeps its neon color best when it is not layered over white, or when the layer of Crocus is kept thick.\" \u2013 Bethany Lemasters Testers report that Crocus shifts in color depending on the type of lighting.

Poi is lighter in color, but it is relatively close to Effetre violet, so then you have the price thing to consider. Evil Queen isn't a bad purple, but my complaint about it is just that it is too dark. Grape Ape striated a lot.\" \u2013 Bethany Lemasters \"All these purples look fairly similar when made into spacers. But I like Evil Queen because it is a slightly brighter purple. It\u2019s a toss-up between Poi and Thai Orchid because they both got great reactions when used over Hades, so I think they can do some neat effects.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"Poi is my favorite.\" \u2013 Sue Stewart \"Evil Queen is the best of the bunch even though it is expensive. Poi is my favorite when encased due to lines of deeper purple that develop. Thai Orchid is my favorite for pulling out a deep silver luster.\" \u2013 Starleen Colon \"For me, I find Grape Ape, Poi and Thai Orchid to be very similar in hue, but with different densities. They definitely have their place in the current palette of purples, but they are very similar. Evil Queen is a very nice medium purple and would get my vote for my favorite of the four. I think Evil Queen is a better neutral medium purple than the Italian colors.\" \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"Grape Ape sometimes has a dirty look to it. Evil Queen can work for flowers if put over Peace. Poi is kinda washed out looking. Thai Orchid is my favorite, dark and opaque.\" \u2013 Pat O'Brien \"Evil Queen seems too close to Moretti in a shade that is less interesting to me. I like Thai Orchid the best. It\u2019s a very rich, pure and dark purple that doesn\u2019t seem to have any gray or other colors in it.\" \u2013 Marcy Lamberson \"If I have to choose, I guess Grape Ape is my favorite because it seems to be the darkest.\" \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \"Evil Queen is hands-down my fav, but it costs quite a bit more, so I generally try to make use of one of the lower priced purples, usually Grape Ape.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"I love Grape Ape because it really is a grapey purple opaque. This color fills a hole in the glass palette. I definitely like Evil Queen the best as it is the most opaque. Poi has a lot of gray tone to it. Thai Orchid is my second favorite of the CiM purples. It\u2019s a bit on the grey side, but is nicely opaque and is easy to use. It melts well and makes a great base bead color.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"I like Evil Queen the best because it is a more true purple. The others have a touch of gray.\" \u2013 Elizabeth Long \"Grape Ape is my favorite. Evil Queen is equivalent to 272 violet to me but more purple than gray, and more lavender than Thai Orchid. Poi is a great purple, I like it. Thai Orchid is a true dark purple to me and I like the reactions with silver glasses.\" \u2013 Elasia \"To me, they are all virtually indistinguishable. I put them all side by side on mandrels, and even under an Ott light it was virtually impossible to see any differences. Two other lampworkers looked at the beads as well, and they saw no difference in them either. The only one a bit different was Evil Queen: it is slightly prettier, a bit purpleier, but considering it\u2019s over 3 times the price of Grape Ape, I don\u2019t see any way to justify the cost difference.\" \u2013 Donna Dorman \"Thai Orchid is my favorite - I just like the colour the best!\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"Grape Ape is one of my favorites. Love the color and how it works. Evil Queen is a favorite of some of my customers. Can\u2019t seem to make anything that I like with Poi. Love how Thai Orchid works but it does get a bit metallic at times.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"I really love Grape Ape. I also think it has nicer working properties [it's firmer and easier for me to work with] at the torch than E Violet. Grape Ape has a richer and deeper color saturation and does not seem to get as dirty as E Violet does. I also really love Thai Orchid because of the richness, depth, and tone of the color.\" \u2013 Bonnie Polinski Special thanks to Bethany Lemasters (x2), Carol Oliver (x2), Vonna Maslanka (x2), & Pat O'Brien for providing the photos in this section.",

Melts beautifully in the flame with no issues at all. \u2013 Trudi Doherty Your Majesty is a new color to the 104 palette. It is a gorgeous rich color that lives up to its name, Your Majesty. \u2013 Paula Schertz Your Majesty is a mid purple transparent that looks quite similar to Effetre mid purple 042. \u2013 Jolene Wolfe Probably a better comparison here would have been if I had used Dark Amethyst, but you can see here that Your Majesty is deeper in hue than Medium Amethyst by a fair bit.

Some of the darker colors, like Bordello seem to \"sink\" into it, as if it were softer. That blurs the interface between the two colors. \u201d \u2013 Tim Gottleber \"This seems to be a nice glass to work with, as it gives a different shade to the 'ivory' category for me. It does have the streakiness of the ivories, so would work well with something you didn\u2019t want an antiqued look too. I was hoping the finished glass would have the pearl look that the rod has, but was not able to achieve this.\u201d \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton Although Butter Pecan is, in general, a non reactive glass, some Messy Color testers reported occasional reactions. \u201cButter Pecan\u2019s reaction with Celadon is one of my favorites of this glass line. I make a lot of floral beads and use this reaction to add interest to my beads.

ASK Silver Brown, in this picture, looks almost the same colour as Canoe, but I don't think that Canoe, even with the addition of silver, strikes to as dark a colour as Silver Brown does.

The result is identical to etched clear glass in terms of opacity, but the subtle blue tone gives it an especially brilliant whiteness.\" \u2013 Celia Friedman Celia Friedman's tumble etching recipe for Cirrus: \"Put your beads, a drop of dishwashing soap, a handful of small glass beads, and a spoonful of silicon carbide grit in a lapidary canister, add enough water to cover that plus a bit more, and tumble for 2-3 hours. Time and grit rating will determine the finished product. 1000 grit for two hours gives a smooth, subtle frost with a pearly gloss coming through, while 800 or 600 will give rougher results. The extra beads should be small, and many sources suggest 3-4 mm, but if you are tumbling large-hole beads those will get stuck in them, so I use mostly 6 mm. Tumbling doesn't texture glass inside grooves or depressions, so unless you like the artistic effect of a partially etched bead, it works best with evenly rounded or perfectly flat beads. Because dimpled hole ends don't etch, I make my tumbling beads with flat ends and dremel down the edges later. \u00a0NOTE: once you put silicon grit in a canister you can never, ever use it, or anything you put in it, for polishing metal.\" \u2013 Celia Friedman Special thanks to Genea Crivello, Suzy Hannabuss, Teri Wathan, Elasia, & Vonna Maslanka for providing the photos in this section.",

      "manufacturer_description": "CiM Tester Feedback Hades has become the \u201cgo to\u201d black for many lampworkers. \"Hades is the best black! I love it. It is the only black, that's really black, without the unpleasant side effects such as devitrification or silver shimmer.\" \u2013 Angela Hadorn \u201cThis is the only black I use, it covers ALL the different blacks for me, great for \u2018just black\u2019 [i.e. not purple like Effetre etc.], for webbing [i.e. intense black], for great reactions with silver foil, leaf and glasses.\u201d \u2013 Elasia \u201cI do use Hades as I like how it stays black; I mostly use it as stringer. I tend to use Effetre black for basic stuff and Hades when it really matters.\u201d \u2013 Julie Fountain \u201cHades is my favorite real black.\u201d \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \u201cTuxedo is my staple black, because of the price difference from Hades. I love Hades as well, but tend to save it for more special applications.\u201d \u2013 Donna Dorman \u201cI use Hades all the time and think it is the best black on the market.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cI prefer Hades to other blacks.\u201d \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \"It is always on the bench when I am working.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \u201cI use this black the most out of any of the blacks on the market. It's more affordable, extremely dense, and doesn't bleed out in my murrini, and it's very neutral in tone. I do like that it can give similar effects as the Italian dense black by \u2018webbing\u2019, so for me this glass is ideal and has the best of both worlds.\u201d \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"Hades does not give you the purple color on white that other blacks have. Hades and silver foil make other silver glasses do amazing things!\" \u2013 Tina Lamasney \u201cHades is my most-often used black, unless I\u2019m using it as filler or someplace not visible, and then I use the less expensive Vetrofond or Effetre Black.\u201d \u2013 Kathy Coon What is the difference between Hades & Tuxedo? Hades is our intense black (will maintain its black color even when pulled into stringer) and Tuxedo is our regular black (less dense). \u201cHades is definitely more black than Tuxedo. It\u2019s like a \u2018premium\u2019 black.\u201d \u2013 Laura Sparling \"To me, Hades is a richer, jet black, while Tuxedo looks the same in a solid bead, but when used as decoration like dots or stringer work, it can look a little less saturated black.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"I consider Tuxedo to be a staple and Hades to be a special glass.\" \u2013 Jolene Wolfe \"For me, Hades is a 'true' black and Tuxedo is a very deep grey. Both Tuxedo & Hades will get a bit squirrelly with enough heat.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"Hades is denser than Tuxedo. Hades is a nice true black that doesn\u2019t bleed purple.\" \u2013 Teri Yount \"Hades acts more like intense black and it stays black. Tuxedo is black but can go grey on white etc. Hades, when blown or made into a hollow or pulled into a stringer, stays black, not purple.\" \u2013 Elasia \"If you melt Hades into white the resulting line will appear black. If you do the same test with Tuxedo, the line appears more purple. I would definitely describe Hades as a real, true dense black. It is the only black I will use from now on.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"Hades webs and Tuxedo does equally as much.\" \u2013 Pat O'Brien How does Hades compare to Effetre intense black? Testers reported that they prefer Hades because of its spectacular reactions with silver and its stiffness. \"Hades is easier to control than Effetre intense black, and will reduce in the presence of silver which Effetre intense black will not do.\" \u2013 Carol Oliver \"Hades is stiffer and easier to control when working as a stringer.\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"Both are \u2018proper\u2019 black instead of really dark purple or blue or whatever, I chose between the two based on how reactive they are with other colors. Hades does wonderful things with many of the silver or reactive glasses, and has great movement when you want it to spread or web. Hades does everything that Intense Black does, plus it is more color reactive with silver glass, costs less and is much more consistent from batch to batch.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"Hades is a more intense black than the Effetre intense black. Hades = Blackgasm. Effetre intense black = dark black. The Effetre will spread and spread whereas the Hades will stay put and behave itself. Hades has a bright glossier shine to it when compared to Effetre, I really like it! The only problem with Hades is that I couldn't see the details as easily as with Effetre. This was due to not getting the dreaded metallic sheen. I did bump my light up a bit and that took care of the problem.\" \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \"Hades and Effetre intense black are about the same. But Hades works great with silver glass and Effetre intense black doesn\u2019t.\" \u2013 Pat O'Brien \"I have only ever used Effetre intense black as fine stringer for lace/web beads \u2013 I find that they both behave very similarly for this purpose. Hades tends to be more affordable and also easier to source in the UK.\" \u2013 Jolene Wolfe \"Hades maintains its crispness better than Intense Black. I work Hades very cool when using it as stringer and it keeps its definition that way.\" \u2013 Laura Sparling \"Hades can take more heat before webbing. That might give it an edge in some situations.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"Hades is a beautiful reactive black. It is even more dense than Tuxedo but doesn't web like intense black. It can sometimes get a bluish shimmer when used with silver or with silver glass.\" \u2013 Caroline Davis Most testers agreed that Hades is a bit stiffer than the Italian blacks. \"Hades is stiffer, but if it is too hot, it behaves much like intense black.\" \u2013 Angela Hadorn \"I loved the way it webs like intense black does, but the fact that it is stiffer makes all the difference for me. I really like this glass a lot.\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"Hades is more stiff which makes it easier to use for a stringer decoration.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"If there is a difference, I can\u2019t tell.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"Hades was VERY easy to sculpt with; it wasn't as stiff as I thought it was going to be.\" \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \"Hades being stiffer makes it a great color to pull into stringer and to rake with.\" \u2013 Bonnie Polinski \"I find them to be very similar in stiffness.\" \u2013 Jolene Wolfe \"Hades is a stiff glass, it is firmer than Effetre, and takes longer to work, but you get better colors and reactions with it than other glass. I love it reduced especially with other reactive colors on top.\" \u2013 Vonna Maslanka Testers report that Hades does web (but not quite as much as Effetre intense black) and only when super heated. If you are looking for a more crisp effect, then try working in a cooler flame. \"Hades does crawl and I love the effect. It makes great organic beads. The crawling can be controlled by the amount of heating. It will crawl more easily on some colors than others.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"Hades crawled only when over heated for a long time. I didn't like it, but I could control it by heating it for a less amount of time even when the heat was very hot! In other words it took me a lot of heat for a long time to get it to crawl. If I used a lot of heat for a shorter [reasonable] time it did not crawl.\" \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \"I rely on it for all of the wonderful webby effects that I used to buy Intense Black for.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"Hades webs, and the more you heat it the more it will do so.\" \u2013 Laura Sparling \"I found that Hades did seem to crawl more when in the direct heat, and for me this is not a good thing. I like to work close to the flame, so when used to make dots on white, they didn\u2019t stay dots.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \"Hades webs when heated well. It webs almost as well as intense black, but not quite as dramatically.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"Hades will web, but it doesn't 'spider web' like Effetre intense black does. It is a different effect.\" \u2013 Tim Gottleber Does Hades have any discernible hue? Most testers only saw black, though some reported seeing green, blue, or brown. \"I didn\u2019t notice any base colour \u2013 I just saw black, black and more black. Which is nice to see in black glass!\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"If it is overheated it deepens to a dark brown.\" \u2013 Angela Hadorn \"I know the glass isn\u2019t really black, but I can\u2019t see anything but a dense black, even in stringer.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"Looks pretty black to me no matter how fine I pull it!\" \u2013 Laura Sparling \"Hades has subtle brown to grey/green hues but does not show a discernable hue other than black until it is superheated.\" \u2013 Bonnie Polinski \"I saw blue, but only in bright sunlight when pulled into thread stringer.\" \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \"It can have a slight grayish green tint around the edges when melted in as decoration and heated so the edges slightly bleed.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"Hades is a very dense black and I did not notice a purple or green hue to it.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton Some testers reported that Hades will \u201cghost\u201d or create a thin parallel line next to itself. \"Hades ghost but only when *really* heated.\" \u2013 Claire Morris \"Hades creates a slight halo when overheated- it has a tendency to ghost more on colors where it doesn\u2019t crawl.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"I noticed ghosting after super-heating the glass.\" \u2013 Vonna Maslanka \"Hades will ghost, but only when boiled.\" \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \"It ghosts with some glasses and not others. Over heating will intensify this effect sometimes. I don't like it when I am trying for crisp lines...it's fun if I am playing organicly. You can control it by encasing it in clear.\" \u2013 Tim Gottleber Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable, Gail Witt (x11), Pat O'Brien (x2), Bonnie Polinski, Elasia (x2), & Sue Stewart for providing the photos in this section.",

      "manufacturer_description": "CiM Tester Feedback Note about Messy Clear We are committed to making an optically clear Clear [no green or blue tints]. During the inspection process, we are careful to remove rods that are not a consistent 4-7 mm diameter, to check that the rods are straight and smooth without bumps, and to remove any rods with seeds, bubbles, stones, or other impurities. We limit handling to prevent scratches, and we package the rods by individually wrapping in tissue paper to prevent scratching during shipment. Like all Messy Colors, our Clear has been formulated and tested to be 104 compatible. \u00a0We strive to be as consistent as possible from batch to batch, and to reproduce the Clear on a timely basis so that it is available when you need it. Our testers are sharply divided about whether or not they like Messy Clear. About half reported that they loved Messy Clear and experienced no problems. The other half reported that they could not cope with what they described as boiling. Thanks to our testers, we\u2019ve been able to establish that the wide range of responses is due to the wide range of working atmospheres. Artists who preferred Messy Clear describe their working style as \u201ccool,\u201d or are quite often using a Hot Head. Several testers who could be described as working \u201chot\u201d noted that they were successful in using Messy Clear without boiling it if they worked it very slowly [much slower than they preferred to work] in the outer reaches of the flame. If you find yourself to be one of the users who can\u2019t seem to prevent Messy Clear from boiling, then I would recommend either working cooler or using a clear that can tolerate working hotter. There is also a relevant point about the ends of our rods. As part of the quality control process, the rods are divided into bundles which are stood vertically and ground over a disc to smooth the ends. Our purpose is to remove any sharp and potentially dangerous edges. Several testers noted that the ground ends of the rods have a tendency to scum. So we discontinued the grinding process for Messy Clear [though we continue to do it on all other color rods]. Thank you to our illustrious testers who have given us this comprehensive feedback. We asked our testers to compare Messy Clear to other 104 clears. [Please note that the variety of responses below were in regards to the same batch of Clear.] \u201cI had just discovered this clear after I got fed up with the Italian clears. So, having had some time to work with CiM's, I prefer it the most because of its clarity and affordability. I have never found it to bubble or boil. It also doesn't scum after working for a long time [I tend to work beads for at least 45 minutes or more].\u201d \u2013 Renee Wiggins \u201cThe clear is awesome, especially the stringers for encasing \u2013 doesn\u2019t boil, few bubbles, great to melt. The Moretti super clear is good as well, but I love the smaller size of Messy Clear.\u201d \u2013 Donna Dorman \u201cMessy Clear is my favorite clear, except when annealing at temps below 950 degrees, as it generally cracks at those temps, or when used with silver-laden glass.\u201d \u2013 Kathy Coon \u201cI sometimes use Messy Clear, but not when I use silver glass.\u201d \u2013 Pat O'Brien \u201cI ONLY use Messy Clear and find that it is almost always compatible with the silver reactive glass that I almost exclusively use at the moment. This most recent batch of test glass, though, was more bubbly and scummy than usual.\u201d \u2013 Sue Stewart \u201cI use Messy Clear as we can\u2019t get Lauscha in the UK, and Effetre and Vetrofond don\u2019t cut it for me. I have found recent batches of Messy Clear not to be as good as previous, it has a tendency to boil and seed and needs to be worked very very cool.\u201d \u2013 Claire Morris \u201cI only use Messy Clear for encased spacers due to the over soft quality of clear. One must carefully watch how much heat builds up in the glass at all times. \u00a0Flame cutting even up very high often will boil the glass despite being conscious of working cool.\u201d \u2013 Starleen Colon \u201cI don\u2019t encase much, but when I do I prefer CiM clear, less issues all around.\u201d \u2013 Elasia \u201cThis is the best clear I've ever used.\u201d \u2013 Terri Budrow-Nelson Some testers reported Clear \"boiling,\" \"scumming,\" or \"frothing.\" \u201cI find that you need to warm CiM colors more carefully to avoid the cracking, boiling. Even though I have observed bubbling and frothing, I find it\u2019s from working the glass too hot. When I move it out a little further, the issue resolves. CiM seems to need to work just a smidgen \u2018cooler\u2019.\u201d \u2013 Jennifer Borek \u201cClear is a dream for me. I have not found it to boil at all.\u201d \u2013 Renee Wiggins \u201cMessy Clear is a boiling problem, even when worked cool on any other torch greater than a Hot Head.\u201d \u2013 Starleen Colon \u201cI have bought Messy Clear about 2 or 3 times and one batch scummed a lot. I sold it to the students, because we use Hotheads on courses and it did not scum that much with a cooler flame.\u201d \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \u201cMy experience with CiM clear is that it likes to be treated on the gentle side, not using lots of heat.\u201d \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood \u201cClear works beautifully for me as long as I clean the tip of the rod, 'cook' it for a while to burn off what little bit of micro-bubbles remain, and then keep working it without letting the rod cool off. Once it cools, I have to peel the tip again and start all over again.\u201d \u2013 Elizabeth Long \u201cI had great luck with Messy Clear; I use the clear all the time. I work in a cooler flame.\u201d \u2013 Donna Dorman \"As for the clear- granted, it's not as crystal clear as Diamond Clear, but it's also not as persnickity or nearly as expensive. I can usually burn off any little bubbles or scum that forms. So CiM clear gets my vote.\" \u2013 Kandice  Seeber Special thanks to Terri Budrow-Nelson for providing the photo in this section.",

      "manufacturer_description": "CiM Tester Feedback How does Tuxedo compare to other 104 blacks? Testers reported that they prefer Tuxedo because it is denser / blacker. \"Effetre turns purple but continues to have crisp lines, while Tuxedo stays black, but fuzzes out around the edges. I'll take the fuzzy lines over the purple tint.\u201d \u2013 Bethany Lemasters \"The third Black on the market is provided by CiM-Messy Color and it is a dark Gray-Black that stays very dense when pulled down to a stringer, making Tuxedo a great contender for best Black on the world market.\" Read more at the Frantz Art Glass blog . \u2013 Patricia Frantz \u201cI like this very neutral black. The Italian glasses tend to be either on the purple side, or green side. Tuxedo's meltability is FAR better than the Italian black, and it is a bit denser. Effetre black [and Vetro] are horrendous. They boil and pit so bad, but at least the Effetre black smooths out. My only problem with Tuxedo is that I couldn't get it to etch properly at all. Tuxedo didn't completely etch smooth matte, it was more of a satin etch. With that said, if I\u2019m not etching, I would prefer Tuxedo over the Italian blacks any day.\u201d \u2013 Renee Wiggins \u201cVetrofond black is denser than Tuxedo. Effetre black is not. With solid work, Tuxedo functions very well. For stringers and dots, the Italian blacks are much better.\u201d \u2013 Angela Hadorn \u201cTuxedo is a true black, not a purple black, and doesn\u2019t \u2018act up\u2019 as the Italian blacks do lately.\u201d \u2013 Elasia \u201cI always use Effetre black. I\u2019ve found that Tuxedo is denser than other 104 blacks but it has an odd effect on some stringer. Example \u2013 Effetre White on Tuxedo goes all wobbly and slightly feathery.\u201d \u2013 Laura Sparling \u201cI find Tuxedo melts more smoothly and is easier to use, so I use this as my go to black.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cThe other blacks are purple, blue, or whatever. Tuxedo is actually black. At the very worst, if it is applied too thinly or allowed to spread out too much, it looks grey.\u201d \u2013 Kathy Coon \u201cTuxedo is a very close second as my favorite black glass to work with \u2013 Hades being my favorite. It does not boil or pit, is a good consistency for sculpting, and while it will web if exposed to enough heat, it does not do so easily enough to pose a big problem.\u201d \u2013 Carol Oliver \u201cTuxedo does not 'purple' out on me like Effetre black. I use Tuxedo for surface decoration only. It overruns other colors and I don\u2019t like the look when compared to the Italian glasses, especially Vetrofond black. It is like Tuxedo is a flatter black than the Italian glasses.\u201d \u2013 Chris Haussler \u201cTuxedo is my staple black, because of the price difference from Hades. Tuxedo is a superb value and it\u2019s a fantastic black to work with.\u201d \u2013 Donna Dorman \u201cTuxedo might be blacker than regular Italian blacks. It is something between them and intense blacks, colour and behavior.\u201d \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \"Tuxedo is a great black, \u00a0it stays black in thin stringer.\" \u2013 Caroline Davis What is the difference between Hades & Tuxedo? Hades is our intense black (will maintain its black color even when pulled into stringer) and Tuxedo is our regular black (less dense). \u201cFor me, Hades is a 'true' black and Tuxedo is a very deep grey. \u00a0Both will get a bit squirrelly with enough heat.\u201d \u2013 Chris Haussler \u201cIf you melt Hades into white the resulting line will appear black. If you do the same test with Tuxedo, the line appears more purple.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cBoth Hades & Tuxedo are \u2018proper\u2019 black instead of really dark purple or blue or whatever; I choose between the two based on how reactive they are with other colors. Tuxedo is rich and stable when I\u2019m not looking for reactions, spreading, or webbing.\u201d \u2013 Kathy Coon \u201cTo me, Hades is a richer, jet black, while Tuxedo looks the same in a solid bead, but when used as decoration like dots or stringer work, it can look a little less saturated black.\u201d \u2013 Lori Bergmann \u201cTuxedo appears to have a purple base, while Hades looks more blue based. Hades is more dense.\u201d \u2013 Teri Yount Technically speaking, Tuxedo is a blue based black, but testers disagreed on their experience of Tuxedo's hue cast. \"Tuxedo is a standard black color, which is a dense transparent like the other black glass versions from Vetrofond and Effetre. But it differs from them in that while Vetrofond has a bluish cast and Effetre has a purple cast when they bleed around the edges, Tuxedo has a grayish-brown cast.\" Read more at Lori's blog . \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"While it looked pure black and grey and white when it went into the kiln - it has stretched and thinned out to both purple and blue, interestingly enough.\" Read more at DragonJools blog . \u2013 Dwyn Tomlinson \u201cA very, very, very dark grey.\u201d \u2013 Chris Haussler \u201cBlue/purple.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cA deep, dark green.\u201d \u2013 Kirsty Naray \"Blue-gray.\" \u2013 Angela Hadorn \"Deep purple/blue.\" \u2013 Carol Oliver \u201cGrey/dark green.\" \u2013 Elasia \u201cNavy blue.\u201d \u2013 Pat O'Brien \"Grey.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon We asked our testers to compare Tuxedo & other 104 blacks in their ease to bleed. Testers reported wildly different experiences. \"I discovered that Tuxedo also has a tendency to bleed much more easily than it's big brother Hades, which is my favorite black that is a more dense and blacker formula and has wonderful reactions with silver colors.\" Read more at Lori's blog . \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"It also does seem to have webbed a little bit.\" \u2013 Dwyn Tomlinson \u201cI like that Tuxedo is a cheaper alternative to Hades, but noticed that it tends to bleed and/or frazzle fairly quickly. And I don\u2019t like it much for stringer work because it gets a brownish tinge around the edges when melted in. When I used it on a twisty combination, it also looked brown instead of black. So I think I\u2019ll be using it just for solid black shapes or as a base layer and using Hades for any stringer or twisty designs. It does seem like it has some nice organic possibilities, as I got a neat reaction with it over Stone Ground.\u201d \u2013 Lori Bergmann \u201cTuxedo is not very popular. It bleeds a lot faster than the Italian black.\u201d \u2013 Angela Hadorn \u201cTuxedo doesn\u2019t bleed or web.\" \u2013 Elasia \u201cTuxedo does web with intense heat, but I think it is much less bleed-y than effetre black.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cTuxedo is much more likely to stay where you put it. I think that it bleeds much less than the Italian blacks.\u201d \u2013 Kathy Coon \"Tuxedo is more bleedy.\" \u2013 Kirsty Naray \u201cTuxedo bleeds more and that\u00b4s why I do not like it. Intense blacks can bleed, if they want to, but I like my regular black to be stable. But \u00a0I have found out there are lot of people, who like it and think it is not bleeding.\" \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \u201cTuxedo will web/bleed when exposed to intense heat, but not as much as Hades or Effetre Intense black.\u201d \u2013 Carol Oliver \u201cIn some applications, Tuxedo does web and bleed on me. It is more prone to bleed than the Italian blacks. I have issues using it next to clear, as it tends to creep over the clear and mess up the line that I am trying to lay down. I use it next to other colors intentionally. When it bleeds then, it is not an issue because it adds an interesting effect to the finished product. If I need to have black next to clear and I am expecting it to behave, I use Vetrofond black or Hades.\u201d \u2013 Chris Haussler \u201cTuxedo webs just as much as Hades does equally as much.\u201d \u2013 Pat O'Brien Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable (x2), Leslie Anne Bitgood (x2), Bethany Lemasters, Pat O'Brien, Carol Oliver, & Sue Stewart for providing the photos in this section.",

The difference is not big though. Cocoa is a bit streakier. They react differently with ivory; Adamantium bled more and Cocoa had a more ragged borderline with ivory.\" \u2013 Maija-Leena Autio \"Adamantium is a slightly lighter, greyer color that I like better than Cocoa, which I find to be a little too dark/dense.\" \u2013 Lori Bergmann \"They are virtually identical in coloration, but I find Adamantium easier to work with. Lauscha is generally sold in larger diameter rods, and I have a hard time melting them without large chunks flying around. I also prefer Adamantium because it stays stiffer when melted. Adamantium looks sort of like 'dark chocolate' to me.\" \u2013 Kathy Coon \"I have loved Cocoa and use it frequently, but have always wished it were a darker brown. Well, Adamantium fits the bill. It is a great dark brown that isn\u2019t similar to Cocoa at all. I used it in several beads for decoration, and in some places it almost appears to be black, which was not what I was looking for. Also, when using Cocoa and melting it into a base bead you can pretty much plan on it getting whispy edges and melting into the surrounding glass. This is a beautiful effect, if that is what you want. \u00a0Adamantium doesn\u2019t even think about making anything but a nice crisp brown dot. There isn\u2019t anything else available in soft glass that fills this niche. \u00a0Many lampworkers have been begging for a dark brown that doesn\u2019t have a red or grey tone to it. Adamantium really looks like the answer for a dark brown.\" \u2013 Gail Witt \"Adamantium is denser and on the grey side. Lauscha cocoa is warmer and spreads to give a painterly effect which I love.\" \u2013 Leslie Anne Bitgood Testers report that Adamantium makes a good base for silver/reactive glasses. \"Adamantium serves as a lovely backdrop for silver inclusions as a darker line appears where silver is applied.\" \u2013 Starleen Colon \"Raku is very pretty on this color.\" \u2013 Jan Whitesel-Keeton \"I must say that Adamantium looks great as a base for the silver glasses, i.e. Double Helix.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable, Elasia, Leslie Anne Bitgood, Pat O'Brien, Teri Wathan, & Sue Stewart for providing the photos in this section.",

Tahitian Pearl is a fabulous, new color to the 104 palette. \u2013 Paula Schertz Many testers noted a similarity between Tahitian Pearl and Effetre Dark Silver Plum. In comparison to Tahitian Pearl, my DSP seems to pit and bubble more than Tahitian Pearl and the metallic finish isn't as even. \u2013 Caroline Davis I want to compare the new color of Tahitian Pearl with Dark Silver Plum from Effetre. Of course the effect is similar. Tahitian Pearl is lighter and gives the effect of brushed metal, with notches, with beautiful crystals. \u2013 Irina Sergeeva Tahitian Pearl is a new reactive colour from CiM, reminiscent of Gunmetal, and close to Effetre Dark Silver Plum. While I love Tahitian Pearl, for me it is too similar to Dark Silver Plum, but not as cost effective. \u2013 Trudi Doherty Tahitian Pearl is WAY easier to use than Effetre Dark Silver Plum. \u2013 Lori Peterson Tahitian Pearl is pretty much the same as Effetre pastel Dark Silver Plum 275. In rod form it\u2019s a very dark purple with a sort of brown tinge to it. I found that it behaved almost identically to Dark Silver Plum and I treated it the same way. For the spacers [shown above] I made the bead and let it cool outside the flame for about fifteen seconds. Then I passed the bead back through the mid-part of the flame - not too hot, not too cold - then brought it out to cool for a few seconds and then repeated this until I had the sheen I was happy with. I\u2019ve found that how you reheat both Tahitian Pearl and Dark Silver Plum affects the final finish. A slow pass through the lower part of an oxygen rich, very low propane flame can bring out the more satin silvery effect, and reheating in a *very* slightly reducing one [propane rich] can give you a haematite-like mirror sheen. Too much reduction, however, and you can end up with a muddy purple-brown with a shimmery haze. Read more at Laura's tumblr . \u2013 Laura Sparling Tahitian Pearl is a dark greyish purple that gets shiny in the flame while you're working it. As you'll see, I went into my relationship with Tahitian Pearl expecting it to be similar to Adamantium, but ultimately found it quite a bit more like Effetre Dark Silver Plum, only with more interesting variation in surface texture.

Please note that glow in the dark rods will be shorter than the standard lengths you have come to expect from CiM. \"We have been missing glow in the dark glass in COE 104! Glow glass in any COE tends to be super shocky and fragile until it's actually in the liquid form. Once you make something with it, the glow lasts and lasts. Preheating the rods or even annealing them prior to use can help with the fragility and ease some of the challenges at the torch. Ultimately, the end results are always worth the little extra effort involved.\" \u00a0-Sheri Spurlock / Melt Glass Art Supply \"I LOVELOVELOVE the glow in the dark glass! Swooooon! Easy melting and lots of glow that's quickly activated by light. Great add to the 104 palette of colors!\" [Later Joy wrote that her second testing was intolerably shocky; please note that experiences seem to vary on a rod to rod basis.] \u2013 Joy Munshower \"I had no trouble with any glass rods that you sent me. Even glow in the dark melted quite good.\" \u2013 Claudia Eidenbenz \"My beads didn't end up cracking, but the rods were awful. The glow glass shatters with the least heat and I was only able to wrap a small spacer from the first 1/3 of the rod with most of that 1/3 ending up on the table.\" \u2013 Melanie Graham \"With my new method of melting by slowly introducing the glass way up above the flame and then slowly moving down, I had no shocking. I made a couple of rounds and a drum with absolutely no difficulty and they glow very nicely.\" \u2013 Gloria Sevey \"This glow in the dark glass was such a pleasure to work with! The beautiful aqua blue glow was very strong and made for a great effect! The glass melted very easily and was not shocky at all. This glass creates a really cool silhouette look when adding black decoration on the bead. A great addition to the 104 line!\" \u2013 Michelle  Veizaga \"The glow in the dark rods break if you look at them wrong. And you can literally snap them with your fingers with almost no effort. The glow bits in the rods are rather large and I think the breaking happens where there are more of them. I did look at them through a polariscope and did not see any stress.\" \u2013 JameyLynn \"I have used glow powder but it is not as convenient as ready made cane. Definitely a different look as well. CiM's glow rods are quite viscous when hot and crack easily when they cool a bit. But the finished pieces are just fine. I was up very early this morning and discovered a pendant I made with the clear based glow still glowing faintly after 8 hours without light.\" \u2013 Chris Haussler \"From my experience making my own glow in the dark rods and using others, shockiness is kind of the nature of the beast. The trick is to warm high in the flame for some time, then bring it down to the working flame area.\" \u2013 Renee Wiggins \"The glow in the dark was very shocky but all my beads survived.\" \u2013 Lori Peterson",

Please examine the photos on this page carefully as we have chosen them to demonstrate this quality. \u201cI did an encased floral with white dots under Gelly's Sty, which made it a very pale, soft pink. The last bead in the group shot [top photo on right] shows dots of raked rubino on a base of Gelly's Sty and encased in Moretti clear. As you can see, although I burnt the rubino a bit, the pink didn't burn or fade.\u201d \u2013 Gelly Davis \u201cThe saturation level is controllable- if you want a light pink, use a small stringer, want more color, you need to use more glass. It is something like a transparent glass in that regard.\u201d \u2013 Tim Gottleber \u201cIt tends to go purple when layered over other colors. I used it over Effetre Black and both times it went a little purple on me. That could be due to it being a tiny bit translucent.\u201d \u2013 Dianna Trout Gelly\u2019s Sty occasionally devitrifies, but this can be controlled by working it extremely hot. \u201cI noticed devitrification while initially working with Gelly's Sty, but I am used to ignoring devit. With EDP I let it devit or even burn all it wants. When I am finished with the bead, I heat each area using high oxygen usually it's lips and toenails on Phants to chase out the devit. With your glass I found I did not have to chase it away. I would assume that those whom it concerns need to work your glass hotter, I work like the devil on a mission and it's never hot enough!\u201d \u2013 Loco \u201cI didn\u2019t have too much of a problem with devit. I don\u2019t work my beads in a really hot flame, but didn\u2019t have any issues.\u201d \u2013 Gail Witt \u201cI experienced devitrification if not worked hot enough.\u201d \u2013 Tina Lamasney \u201cI also experienced devit. But when I worked it really low in the flame, the devit went away.\u201d \u2013 Stephanie Risberg Gelly\u2019s Sty is unique to the 104 glass color palette. \u201cA great pink! It fills a void in my palette. It is a wonderful color.\u201d \u2013 Tim Gottleber \u201cIt is a wonderful pink in a world of glass that does not have many good pinks. It presses well, makes great focals, combines well with other colors, and holds it color. On occasion it can even be a little streaky. . . This glass will become one of my staple colors.

I didn't think it was a problem, just a working property of the glass, a bit like yellows go red and reds go black until they cool again.\" \u2013 Heather Johnson \"I got grey when heating at first, but then I treated this colour like I do striking colours, so I gave it plenty of reheats, slightly cool, reheat, etc. This removed the grey.

Instead of melting a pea sized gather and applying on the mandrel I applied the glass to the mandrel in small increments, like layering.

I made some beads with the dark rod of Watermelon and very little light came through the glass and the color was unappealing to me. However, the dark rod of Chocolate is a very nice brown. With such a huge difference between rods, I think it\u2019s kind of a confusing sale if dark and light rods are presented as the same color.\" \u2013 Gloria Sevey Many testers reported that our cloudy transparents were prone to shockiness or breakage. **Please pre-warm / pre-anneal rods accordingly.** \"In general, I have found the Cloudy Transparent colours to be a bit shocky. For the most part, this was quite manageable and well worth the effort, at least for the colours I've tried so far.\" Read more at Melanie's blog . \u2013 Melanie Graham \"I experienced neither shockiness nor boiling with the cloudy transparents. I did use a cool flame though. I\u2019ve changed my method of introducing glass rods to the flame which reduces shocking considerably [almost non-existent unless there are holes in the rod]. I rotate the tip of my rod way above the flame for a short time and then slowly rotate it downward into the flame. It\u2019s usually starting to melt by that time. That said, not everyone uses this cautious of a method and might have rods being shocky because of being put into the flame when they\u2019re still cold.\" \u2013 Gloria Sevey \"In the new cloudy colors it does seem the thicker the rod the more saturated the color seems to be. I had zero issue with Heather, Morgan and Watermelon. However my beloved Pink Lemonade and Vintage Rose were super shocky even with kiln warming.\" \u2013 Michelle  Veizaga \"Heather is a little shocky so a little pre-warming and careful introduction to the flame is all that\u2019s needed. I\u2019ve not had a lot of luck as Heather layered over Effetre White cracked [probably thermal] and when I tried over CiM Peace I got all sorts of crazy cracks. I found Chocolate a bit shocky, certainly more so than Watermelon which surprised me since they are both cloudy transparents and made in the same way. However pre-warming the rod seemed to help and the shocky-ness certainly wouldn\u2019t put me off.\" \u2013 Heather Johnson \"I agree with the mostly-too-shocky.\" \u2013 Dwyn Tomlinson \"I made a clear base and encased with the cloudy transparents, but sadly the beads cracked.\" \u2013 Trudi Doherty \"I experienced micro cracks when combining several of the cloudy transparents with 96 COE frit.\" \u2013 Darlene Collette \"I didn\u2019t have any problems with the cloudy transparents! They weren\u2019t shocky or boiled, but I have to admit, that I work in a cold flame and very carefully to prevent any bad incident.\" \u2013 Claudia Eidenbenz \"I found them intolerably shocky.\" \u2013 Laurie Nessel \"I preheated all the testing rods in a Devardi rod warmer as it was particularly cold in the UK at that time and this is something I always do that time of year. By doing this I didn't experience any shockiness. I also used a very thin encasement of Effetre Superclear 006 before applying cloudy transparents as an encasement - no issues.\" \u2013 Juliette Mullett \"I found the cloudy transparents shocky, that they boiled easily in the flame which created micro bubbles on the surface of beads, and that under clear encasement some of them cracked.\" \u2013 Jolene Wolfe Some testers reported that our cloudy transparents were prone to boiling. \"I did find some cloudy transparents could boil if you worked them too hot. I like to work them cooler and with not too much oxygen in the flame.\" \u2013 Trudi Doherty \"I had no issues with any of the cloudy transparents apart from a little bubbling in 1 or 2 of them.\" \u2013 Juliette Mullett \"Another thing common to all of these colours [so far] is that they can be easy to boil, so you really have to watch your heat. This is true not only with fine stringer, but also when applying the glass from the rod to your bead. Work higher up in the flame and a bit cooler to avoid this problem.\" Read more at Melanie's blog . \u2013 Melanie Graham Testers were divided on whether or not they liked the wispy or streaky quality of the cloudy transparents. \"All but two of the new color strands sold and the two that didn\u2019t sell didn\u2019t get much attention [Chocolate and Heather, both cloudy transparents]. I think that maybe those cloudy transparents just didn\u2019t have enough zing to capture the mood hopes of this moment in time.\" \u2013 Gloria Sevey \"There are lots of straight transparents. I'd vote for more cloudy transparents. If the glass is wispy then you can use those qualities to your advantage when making beads.\" \u2013 Carol Ann Savage \"I loved the wispy/streaky quality, for me that was a big part of the attraction.\" \u2013 Trudi Doherty \"I think the wispy/streaky quality is great for certain designs, but it's not something I prefer.\" \u2013 Laurie Nessel \"I quite like the wispy quality, but I do like the more saturated streaks.\" \u2013 Heather Johnson \"Some of my studio mates were unhappy with the color saturation in the cloudy transparents, particularly when making blown beads.\" \u2013 Janet Evans \"I thought the wispiness was an upside.

It wasn\u2019t a shocky glass so I\u2019m guessing it was just a rogue rod or maybe it was indeed just me? Other testers have made fabulous beads from this glass so one to try again.\" \u2013 Bianca Gruber Special thanks to Claudia Eidenbenz for the photo in this section.",

Blue Honey is the rarest of all honeys because it comes from the Blue Bumble Bee. The Blue Bumble Bee first came about when a guy named Dave used to play the blues for fields of wild flowers. All of those wild flowers started taking in the blues and created blue pollen which the local bumble bees used to make their hives with. After many seasons of Dave playing the blues for the buzzing and bumbling locals he noticed that these bees had turned blue. They were a more laid back kind of bee. Dave checked out their hive one day after following one of these blue dudes back to their den where he found the Blue Honey. When you want the best, where do you reach? To the top shelf!
