//  FEATURE ABANDONED - ItemMinimum functionality removed to focus on core app features
//

// This file has been intentionally left empty as the ItemMinimum feature
// was abandoned to focus on core app functionality first.
// 
// Core features to focus on:
// - GlassItemRepository
// - InventoryRepository  
// - LocationRepository
// - Basic catalog and inventory tracking
//
// ItemMinimum (shopping lists, minimums) can be added later as an optional feature.
