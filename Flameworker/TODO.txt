Only store inventory in rods, even if we wishlist or record purchases in pounds

Figure out how to accommodate tubes, jars of frit, sheets -- and then also non-glass maybe, like enamels and goldstone

Also, add shopping lists that go beyond glass: adding tools, courses, etc.

Add enamels!

think through how I use/used obsidian and evernote for ideas, project planning, sketches, etc.?
-- oooh indexing uploaded PDFs/images possible?

Murinni, both purchased and made?

crazy but... down the road, support forwarding emails and parsing them to create purchase records automatically?

add a settings page to show the core data version, app version, build date, etc.

it's really important to solve the inclusion of frit, rods, sheet glass, etc. before release, as it will change the data model. maybe we encode this into the item ID in some way. and that can go into the bar code too, along with each manufacturer getting a unique number.
