Only store inventory in rods, even if we wishlist or record purchases in pounds

Figure out how to accommodate tubes, jars of frit, sheets -- and then also non-glass maybe, like enamels and goldstone

Also, add shopping lists that go beyond glass: adding tools, courses, etc.

Add enamels!

think through how I use/used obsidian and evernote for ideas, project planning, sketches, etc.?
-- oooh indexing uploaded PDFs/images possible?
