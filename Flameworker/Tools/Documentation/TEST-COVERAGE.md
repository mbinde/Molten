This file documents first what we have that is covered by tests, and then a list of "todos" that we can add as we have time/energy

Review README.md for more project information if you haven't already.

Here is the initial prompt as we begin:

Following README.md and TEST-COVERAGE.md for your guidance, instructions, and how we work together...:

Following some massive issues with the testing suite, I've reset it entirely and we will need to recreate it, piece by piece, watching for conflicts, hangs, etc.

TEST-COVERAGE will be the file you will be updating as you go -- tests we've written should be summarized in "Tests done". We should keep a running tally of "test coverage by area" so we know where to work on next. And any time we get an idea for a new test, it should be added to "test todo brainstorming" -- and this is also the list that we can refer to for what we need to eventually add to the list. When we are done, the "test todo brainstorming" should be able to be empty (or all marked checked off) and all of them should be up in tests done.
