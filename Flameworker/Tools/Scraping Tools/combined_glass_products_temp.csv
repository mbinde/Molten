BB,BB-32-T-BlueHoney,Blue Honey,,,Blue Honey is as rich and deep as Dave's Blues before you heat it up. When you strike it retains its' translucence but gets waves of purples and gains a greenish blue appearance. It's a very workable color but refrain from a heavily reducing environment. Blue Honey is the rarest of all honeys because it comes from the Blue Bumble Bee. The Blue Bumble Bee first came about when a guy named Dave used to play the blues for fields of wild flowers. All of those wild flowers started taking in the blues and created blue pollen which the local bumble bees used to make their hives with. After many seasons of Dave playing the blues for the buzzing and bumbling locals he noticed that these bees had turned blue. They were a more laid back kind of bee. Dave checked out their hive one day after following one of these blue dudes back to their den where he found the Blue Honey.,"""blue"", ""orange"", ""reducing"", ""striker"", ""yellow""",,33,rod,https://store.borobatch.com/products/boro-batch-blue-honey,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0911/6406/files/Bluehoney.png?v=1741871884,

Stringers come in 0.5 mm (“Fine Line”), 1 mm, and 2 mm thicknesses and are approximately 17.75"" (451 mm) long. They are packed in clear plastic tubes that are 18"" (457 mm) long and 0.75"" (19 mm) in diameter. Tubes are packaged by volume. A tube of .0.5 mm stringer contains approximately 350 pieces. A tube of 1 mm stringers contains approximately 123 pieces. A tube of 2 mm stringer contains approximately 50 pieces. Tubes of colors made with gold contain fewer stringers, to reduce unit price. For example, a tube of gold-bearing 1 mm stringers contains approximately 87 pieces, while a tube of 2 mm stringers contains approximately 33 pieces. Like our sheet glass, stringers are made by hand.

DH,DH-oracleblack,Oracle Black,,,"Summary: Oracle-Black; Neutral with striking colors, reactive with lusters. Kiln-strikes to final opacity and tonality.. Description: Oracle-Black made in typical Double Helix fashion; with unconventional approaches to glass chemistry using low toxicity ingredients. Oracle-Black has smooth working characteristics, reads “darker” than some existing black glasses, does not spread excessively, and can be worked very hot without boiling. It is made in USA without Antimony, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Nickel, or Selenium. Rods are dark blue but strike to black during the annealing cycle. Stays neutral with striking colors but reacts to luster colors. For maximum opacity, particularly in thin applications, briefly cool the bead then lightly flame strike (30 seconds) before annealing for 2 hours or more at 950F. The Oracle projec t is an extension of what we’ve already done with Aether, Zephyr and Rhea; create low-toxicity, essential glass colors for the flame. We will be producing colors free from antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and selenium. Oracle-Black, Oracle-White (coming in 2018), Rhea, and Zephyr give 104 flame workers the option to use responsibly manufactured, low toxicity glasses in their work. Stunning. Buttery smooth to work, and the silver reactions are outstanding.

A major improvement over Luna 3 and Khaos, it resists over striking to khaki. Skiron works best when reset, cooled, and struck. Cooling and striking times will vary based on bead size, flame temperature, and other factors but general guidelines are; Surface applications: reset, cool for 30 seconds, strike for 30-45 seconds. Encased applications: encase, reset, cool for 45 seconds, strike for 45-60 seconds. The cooling cycle is an important factor in repeatable end results. Shorter than recommended cooling times typically yield white and purple, while longer cooling times can yield dark Amber with blue tints.

Here’s a short video of the process. In our experience, a brush reduction flame produces the best results. Tips from Jed: It does require particular flame settings, and bead heat and reduction duration are more critical. My specific timings work for my specific set up. It is going to vary from person to person. Here is my process. 1) Shape bead 2) Allow bead to cool for 20 seconds. 3) Adjust flame so candles are stretched 2mm from neutral. 4) Pass bead through flame, candles should touch bead and deflect yellow flame around the edges. 1.5 seconds duration for each pass. 5) Allow bead to cool 5 seconds between passes. 6) Repeat pass-through and cooling cycle 5-15 times. 7) Anneal.","""luster"", ""reducing""",,33,rod,https://doublehelixglassworks.com/product/iris/,,https://doublehelixglassworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Iris-Redux-510x487.jpg,test

DH,DH-oracleblack,Oracle Black,,,"Summary: Oracle-Black; Neutral with striking colors, reactive with lusters. Kiln-strikes to final opacity and tonality.. Description: Oracle-Black made in typical Double Helix fashion; with unconventional approaches to glass chemistry using low toxicity ingredients. Oracle-Black has smooth working characteristics, reads “darker” than some existing black glasses, does not spread excessively, and can be worked very hot without boiling. It is made in USA without Antimony, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Nickel, or Selenium. Rods are dark blue but strike to black during the annealing cycle. Stays neutral with striking colors but reacts to luster colors. For maximum opacity, particularly in thin applications, briefly cool the bead then lightly flame strike (30 seconds) before annealing for 2 hours or more at 950F. The Oracle projec t is an extension of what we’ve already done with Aether, Zephyr and Rhea; create low-toxicity, essential glass colors for the flame. We will be producing colors free from antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and selenium. Oracle-Black, Oracle-White (coming in 2018), Rhea, and Zephyr give 104 flame workers the option to use responsibly manufactured, low toxicity glasses in their work. Stunning. Buttery smooth to work, and the silver reactions are outstanding.

DH,DH-auraelight,Aurae Light,,,"Summary: Reduction Color. Description: Aurae light has the same silver-reduction strength as regular Aurae with a pink base color. Variations in the reduction process create mirrored, iridescent or satin textured lusters. If encased, the luster results in a pearlescent effect. Work in a neutral flame. Cool until the glass is no longer glowing. Expose the glass to a reduction flame, while keeping it from getting hot. Brief (5-10 seconds) and repeated exposures produces the best results. For the satin textured luster, work in the tip of a larger reduction flame, let cool and then briefly reduce again until a subtle texture begins to form. See our How To section for more detailed working information and tips on using our reduction colors. What are Odd Lots (Light, Dark, Odd) An Odd Lot is a batch of a regular stock color that did not pass its color matching test. If it was lighter than the standard, it’s labeled light. Darker, labeled Dark. For any other non color matching reason, it’s labeled Odd. Therfore, one batch of Light to another will not necessarily be the same. Some could be slightly lighter than the standard and others much lighter. A picture of the current batch of Light is in the gallery for your reference.

With a (relatively) high resistance to thermal shock, 740.opl can be worked hot and fast in the torch flame. It is significantly stiffer than a typical opaque white glass, making it suitable for sculptural work, bead cores, and stringers. Working notes: -To retain the transparent opal effect, reset before annealing and limit kiln temperature and annealing time. I use 930F for less than an hour for misty-opal beads. -740.opl can be used as a core in place of opaque white glasses. For maximum opacity, anneal at 950F for 2 hours of more. Clear encasement seems to accelerate opacification in the annealer. The 740.opl’s reset and striking temperatures are lower than that of silver glasses. When reset, the glass is crystal clear, and when fully struck the glass is opaque white. Variable opacity can be produced by controlling the thermal history of the workpiece. — The Oracle Project – responsibly manufactured, low toxicity glasses made in the USA, without Antimony, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Nickel, or Selenium.

This color works great in the neutral flame region and can handle all flame atmospheres for short amounts of time. Do not use a highly reducing flame or a very sharp hot flame without quick movement of the color; this will avoid any possibility of minor boil spots. The vibrancy of Acid Yellow Crayon is a wonderful backing to many Glass Alchemy transparent colors, also a very complimentary color to the other opaques, and desirable for murine applications as well.

Then when the piece is completed and ready to put away I will increase propane in the flame and flash the piece in and out of the fire to bring the metallic reduction to the surface. This has yielded metallic colors ranging from a shiny copper penny to a beautiful rainbow iridescence. You can also repeatedly kiln your finished piece at 1040F to 1100F to achieve a metallic effect, leaving a slight luster finish of blues and purples and sometimes cream and green on top of your underlying dense browns and reds.

I love to encase this color with clear on a piece that will be worked for a couple hours.

Working Tip: Work this color like you would Triple Passion or a similar striking color. Since this color also has chrome it in work it in a neutral flame and garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “Andromeda is a transparent green sparkle that strikes when heated to a transparent amber that will continue to strike to a deep purple, if the layer of color is thick enough. In addition to the base color there is sparkle and silver that will fume the surface of the color as it gets worked. You can treat Andromeda similar to GA Triple Passion and use an intense, sharp flame to burn off the silver fume on the surface if you wish to show the brilliance of the sparkle in the finish of your piece. You can get a range of finishes with this color without encasement, depending on how long the color is worked and in what flame atmosphere. I have found that when encased in clear, Andromeda handles very well and the clear can often intensify the sparkle. If worked before encasement you can trap silver fuming off the color and have a milky blue ghostly veil over your sparkle green or purple. The sparkle flakes in Andromeda seem to reflect a rainbow of color, ending in gold. The color can be manipulated by twisting, compressing, layering and thinning the amount of color used and how it is worked into your piece, resulting in a number of finishing looks. When kiln striking the base color to shift into deeper colors try 1100 degrees Fahrenheit for short intervals of time until you see the desired results.

GA,GA-A-833,Beryl,,,"Beryl, 833 was designed as an organic color to fill a huge hole in the borosilicate palette.

Working Tip: Work in neutral flame to avoid reduction (red streaks). Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""This is one of my favorite translucent WYSIWYG colors. This brownish olive green transparent is wonderful for solid color sculpting and works very nicely for blown work as well. For larger blown work, I recommend sandwiching between a clear tube and another layer of clear or transparent color, reason being that Beryl is made up of a significant amount of copper. When a heavy copper color is not encased and on the surface for blown work that will be melted, blown, and manipulated it will tend to react with different amounts of propane and oxygen in your flame mix. So where Beryl may feel similar to working clear, it will prefer working about halfway to three quarters of the flame length away from the tip of your torch in an even mix of gas. Heavy reduction or propane in the flame mix, very close to the tip of your torch, will react with the copper in the color causing different surface effects. A very natural tone for your color palette, Beryl will compliment many other Glass Alchemy colors and when standing alone should be given the opportunity for light to transmit through the color for best presentation."" - Mike Shelbo","""reducing""",,33,rod,https://glassalchemy.com/products/beryl-833,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0965/6730/products/833_6373080d-5091-4cd1-9313-7140e010a715.jpg?v=1608591566,

GA,GA-A-9977,Eclipse,,,"Eclipse is our most popular, easy to use black. When pulled down thin, Eclipse maintains a smoky black color, versus purple, like Black Violet. Described by many as “bullet proof”, Eclipse does not contain any chrome, so graying and checking are not a major concern. If you need a more saturated black, check out Raven, 9749. Working Tip: This color can handle different flame atmospheres but as always, we recommend working in a neutral flame. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “Eclipse is a dense, transparent black that can withstand long working hours and many flame atmospheres. It work smooth and melts into itself without a trace of layering. It is a bit stiffer than clear when blowing it out or drawing it down. Eclipse stringers are black down to 1mm when they appear to be a dense smoky transparent black. A 2mm or 3mm thick layer of Eclipse over any tubing is enough to create the appearance of a solid black colored tube; keeping the clear underneath helps core heat remain while you work and saves on color versus coiled solid color. Reheating as many times as you want and numerous or long hours of kiln cycles don't seem to be an issue with Eclipse. I used it inside and on the back of large marbles with great results. Basically it’s my new go to black. I use GA Raven all the time and now Eclipse will fill tons of those jobs where really long flame exposure time or atmosphere was previously an issue with how my black looked in the finish of the piece. Eclipse stays really black with a super gloss finish that makes it the best and most workable black I have tried in the color palette for today's lampworker.” – Mike Shelbo","""black""",,33,rod,https://glassalchemy.com/products/eclipse-9977,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0965/6730/products/9977_44b6d475-d2f9-4314-887f-603ec5852637.jpg?v=1608660785,

This color holds up well in encasement and can be mixed with other colors to create custom super sparkle colors! Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “GA Jackpot has large flakes of sparkle giving this transparent deep money green an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. Whether you stripe, coil, mash, layer, twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changing the “look” or finish. You can achieve a larger flake or sparkle when the rod is applied and worked in flat without much manipulation. This color is great for every application including solid work, with or without encasement. Hollow forms will yield a beautiful array of effects depending on the thickness in color layer. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Jackpot will be transparent yet still lend a lot of sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Jackpot is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result would be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant base color. At any time, a thin layer of clear over Jackpot will often ""brighten"" it up a bit and the encasement always helps amplify the sparkle while leaving your surface clean and crisp. Jackpot can be encased in thick clear for marbles and sculptures.

As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""With sparkle flakes this big there are a lot of possibilities for the finish with GA Paparazzi. What I am referring to is the fact that if you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble and the tight satin like pattern that is formed. Another possible finish effect with GA Paparazzi is when the rod is applied and worked flat. Without much manipulation, you will see much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the “look” or finish. This color is great for every application including solid with or without encasement. Hollow forms with varying thickness in color layer will yield a beautiful array of effects. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Paparazzi will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finishing look.

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""This rich color has a lot of potential for different finishes depending on whether you kiln strike and/or flame reduce. The base color is similar to GA Triple Passion, but moves into deep purples quickly. This color sometimes reminds me of a concord grape in the way that the light bursts and highlights of ghosty silver-blue appear over a deep warm purple. The purple will become darker and darker the longer it is worked and if your piece goes into the kiln and you still want a darker color, then strike at 1100 F for 15-20 minutes extra. You can always change the look of the top layer of Passion Extreme by blasting a sharp and hot flame onto the surface, immediately cutting through the silver build up and reversing the strike of the ""skin"" of the color. From there it's just in how you expose it to the flame or kiln that will determine the outcome of this wonderful color. Passion Extreme holds up well in blown and solid applications, and thin stringers hold color well. When sandwiched under clear more light blue fumey effects are showcased over the base color.

The striking properties range from rubies to purples and blues, yellows and greens. While working the piece you will see continuous color shifts and you should consider how thick your color application is and at what point you would like the color to stop changing. For example, increased kiln time and temp will strike out the rubies and purples leaving you with a different looking piece that went in the kiln. The mixing of results that you will find as you work this color is just gorgeous. I find myself wanting to keep the array of pinks, oranges, rubies and yellows that earned the persimmon reference, but the light greens and blues that show up during the sculpting process compliment the other colors so well, a delicate balance of intense spot heating and reheating is needed to capture the whole range in one piece.

Sienna is a cinnamon brown that can be predictable and the intensity can be controlled by thickness of color application. When drawing down into stringers you can encase solid clear or color with Sienna and achieve a very light tint, or in blown application get an extremely subtle tint by sandwiching in clear and blowing thin. Sienna handles just like GA Beryl or GA Cobalt 1, in the way that is holds heat well, melts into itself smoothly, and leaves no trace of where color was layered upon itself.

Getting this color white hot will cause excessive gas release that can not be repaired and should therefore be avoided.

If desired, Sno White can be sandwiched between clear and blown out very thin and achieve a slightly translucent or milky finish. Without encasement in clear or another color you must work Sno White like other crayon colors and try to do most heating about an inch or so further out than where you work your clear glass. It can handle quick heats with an intense, hot and sharp flame, but do not overheat tiny areas and you will avoid bubbling.Sno White melts into itself smoothly and easily without trace of where color overlaps itself. For thick, solid sculpture work, I prefer to encase clear rod with Sno White so the core of the sculpture is more flexible and can hold core heat longer.

When working Starry Night you must keep the surface in mind as the silver will push out in a ghost blue transparent cloudiness. You can remove the cloudiness with an intense spot heat, or let it build up to a slightly cream colored fume. Either way, there are loads of sparkles and possibilities for swirling silver into your pieces. I found I liked putting a thick layer of Starry Night over a clear tube, melting it smooth, encasing it with 6mm clear rod and then melting that to either stretch down, or blow out thin.

GA,GA-NG-490,Tonic,,,"Tonic has a vintage glass look and is a younger sibling of Rain Drop. For best results, this crisp, high index color should be used in a neutral flame. Working Tip: Work neutral to oxidizing for best results. A reducing flame will cause red streaking. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""Tonic is a transparent blue, the color of an aquamarine gem. The color becomes more vibrant and its higher refractive index shows when used with itself in applications that allow the Tonic layer to be as thick as possible. When used as tubing, applied on clear or as coiled color, if the Tonic will be exposed to a lot of different working flames and long times in and out of the kiln, I advise a thin clear coat to protect the surface from overworking. Too much propane in your flame can result in a copper reduction leaving you with red streaks or patches on the surface of the un-encased Tonic. Too much over oxidizing can leave you with a surface haze or scuzz that must be swiped to remove. I often recommend a thin layer of clear frit over Tonic or evenly coated clear rod over your entire prep. I have used Tonic without encasement many times on solid sculpture and had good results, but I have seen a warming or flashing flame haze up a section. Working Tonic in as close to a neutral flame and away from the face of your torch is wise and will get you the best results with the color. If you have worked Raindrop in the past, this color is very similar in working properties. My favorite application is to gather up rods into 18mm or thicker sections and sculpt them into figurines. This next generation transparent is definitely a must have to fill out the rainbow palette. It can be layered over other colors like white for a nice pastel, but will be a faint tint unless applied as a 5-7mm thick layer. The first impression Tonic made on me was the thought that it was the color of window glass or old soda bottles, both aqua blue colors that I have always been fond of.” – Mike Shelbo","""reducing""",,33,rod,https://glassalchemy.com/products/tonic-490,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0965/6730/products/Tonic_31601bb0-2dfc-45e8-b247-377928df2c8e.jpg?v=1607558339,

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""This color is a natural earth-toned opaque greenish blue. Turquoise is great for solid sculpture and blown work. The density of the color will stay true to the color of the rod before manipulation but when blown, it can become a milky translucent and opalescent version of itself. This is best achieved by sandwiching between clear and blowing thin. Turquoise works creamy but the slightest bit stiffer than other opaques. Overworking the surface of the color when not encased in clear can lead to undesired surface texture and finish.

This blue is a deep, opaque color that is darker than Peacock, but still a very distinct blue that has a special place in the color palette. It works great for sculpting solid work and for blown work. Twilight lends well to many styles of application.

If you’re looking for a tricky color – this is probably the trickiest I’m continuing to learn to date. There’s some resources online, but to bring them here: As it’s worked, it strikes from black to blue to white. If you lay on dots of clear / color over this color, it will seek towards that strike rapidly. This makes it not too ideal for encasement, so proceed with caution on that front. If you love NS-127 I’d say play with this color. Just don’t invest yourself into your first couple/few pieces with it until you learn how it plays. This color’s a whole different beast in terms of its striking nature. I use in my solid work, pendants mostly. You don’t have to do much of anything to get the range of colors. Customers are very attracted to the color. If used on a blown piece I never melt it totally in. I haven’t found the mix of gas to matter.
