When you strike it retains its' translucence but gets waves of purples and gains a greenish blue appearance. It's a very workable color but refrain from a heavily reducing environment. Blue Honey is the rarest of all honeys because it comes from the Blue Bumble Bee. The Blue Bumble Bee first came about when a guy named Dave used to play the blues for fields of wild flowers. All of those wild flowers started taking in the blues and created blue pollen which the local bumble bees used to make their hives with. After many seasons of Dave playing the blues for the buzzing and bumbling locals he noticed that these bees had turned blue. They were a more laid back kind of bee. Dave checked out their hive one day after following one of these blue dudes back to their den where he found the Blue Honey. When you want the best, where do you reach? To the top shelf!

If you work it as a base color for awhile, it will turn opaque in the middle, appearing as if you had encased an opaque red with a transparent one."" – Chris Molter ""Sangre is nice and easy to strike red, especially if not played with too much. The longer you work with the glass in the flame, the darker and more opaque it became. I did have two beads turn out to be an 'iodine orange'."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton ""I love this color. It's the easiest striking red I've gotten the pleasure to play with. I've spent 15 + minutes trying to strike moretti or vetro transparent red, and with Sangre, just had to try one time! It also doesn't burn out easily."" – Evil Glass ""Sangre is a wonderful striking red that strikes easily. A must for every beadmaker's palette!  Thinly over clear it glows and is crisp and bright over white."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood ""It is a truer red than most I have used. It also strikes more evenly, but can also overstrike and turn translucent, or run to clear when worked a long time. I found it very soft for a transparent color, which makes it a bit more difficult to work sculpturally. On the other hand, the softness of the glass made it easy to go back in and add texture/ detail, so that was some compensation in terms of its use sculpturally."" – Elise Swope ""This red is really awesome. If you don't keep continuous heat on it it remains transparent. If you continually heat it, it goes opaque. Very cool."" – Genea Crivello ""Sangre is a definite blood red, easy to strike, kind of translucent. I worked this a long time and it didn't burn like the Lauscha translucent red can do."" – Kevan Aponte ""I really do like Sangre, it holds itself well to being abused, being placed in reduction and with reactive glasses with it."" – Claire Morris ""Sangre is one of my favourite reds [apart from Maraschino] as it's fuss free, easy to strike and a gorgeous shade!"" – Trudi Doherty Testers were divided on whether or not Sangre & Oz make the perfect holiday red & green colors.

I have an issue with Sangre though. I cannot consistently work the glass to a true transparent when used as a base bead. I often have swirls or layers in the center of my bead that are opal or even opaque. If I heat the bead enough to 'burn' the color out and then strike it back to red, I don’t strike it consistently to an even red. But compared to the Italian reds, Sangre works better and doesn’t suffer from getting too much heat."" – Chris Haussler ""I did find the Sangre was a much nicer Christmas red on larger beads; on smaller ones it seemed a bit washed out."" – Donna Dorman ""Definitely Christmas colors. I don’t usually make 'theme' beads, but if I were to make something for Christmas these colors look perfect."" – Gail Witt ""They are a good color combination for Christmas colors."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton ""The problem with Sangre, in the context of it being a 'Christmas red,' is that it looks much more like 'Bloody Halloween red.' When the color separates out it looks like blood that has been separated into cells and serum, or whatever the proper medical terms are. It’s a beautiful red, and, except when it does the separated-blood thing, is very much a pure, bright Christmas red."" – Kathy Coon ""Sangre is the perfect Christmas red."" – Elizabeth Long ""Yes, they're perfect!

I got transparency…crystal clear orange which is what I was hoping for. I either didn’t get to translucent or past it."" – Sue Stewart “I never got Clockwork to strike to translucency, only semi-transparency."" – Teri Yount “I had a hard time getting Clockwork to strike consistently. Sometimes I couldn’t get the orange to come up and it would remain transparent, but that was only about 15% of the time. I especially had trouble with striking after pressing."" – Terri Budrow-Nelson “It was a little difficult to strike when working a small spacer after I had heated it to the point of losing its color. But once it started to strike, it happened very quickly. I work mainly with large focals and bringing out the translucency in them was very easy."" – Chris Molter “It took me awhile to get the hang of striking Clockwork as it seemed to strike differently than other striking glass. I found that I would think it wasn’t going to strike and put it in the blanket to move on and when it had cooled, it was a wonderful orange."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton “Clockwork seems to stay more transparent if not over heated in intense heat while working. Shorter bursts of heating and allowing the bead to cool seem to keep it more transparent. If the color was lost, you can easily bring it back by letting the bead cool and then gently flashing it in and out of the flame until you see the color turn back to orange."" – Genea Crivello ""I found that it stayed clear and not translucent. It is easy to strike, except for very thin applications."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood “I wasn’t quite able to strike it as transparent as I wanted, but I was pleased with the result nonetheless. On each of my beads the Clockwork was evenly translucent with no variation of color saturation. I noticed on several of Vonna’s beads that she was able to achieve a wide range of color from yellow-orange to bright orange, and from transparent to opaque to opacify, she flashed her bead in and out of a reduction flame."" – Bonnie Polinski ""I’ve never quite gotten the hang of working with Clockwork.

CIM,277,Phoenix,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Phoenix can be struck to a wide range of hues. ""If you've ever used effetre's Powder Pink, this color is like that but yellow-tan/orange hues. The more or less you strike, it goes through the color phases . . .  First the tan, strike more and it will go orange . . .very fun to use and play with the color changes."" – Elasia ""At first I thought, here we go with more orange/coral tones that Effetre bombarded us with a year ago, however Phoenix rises to the top of my coral red favorite list.  Solid beads unstruck are a lovely vibrant medium shade terracotta peach tone.  Fully struck, a deep terracotta roof tone.  Perfect glass for sculpture as one can selectively strike areas to produce all of the above tonalities in one object.  Color is sensitive to annealing temperatures which can work for or against you.  The lovely cream light peach tone will darken quickly in higher anneal temps of 975 +.  Plan projects ahead and place objects made of Phoenix in the annealer last."" – Starleen Colon ""Phoenix is very comparable to Eff. Peachy Perssimon Coral, or other darker orangy corals. It's a very rich, creamy color. I tend to work my beads for a long time, so I wasn't able to get the light peach color to work for me, but the dark orange color is nice just the same. I wanted to test if this color reacts with silver colors, and it does . . . the reaction is very similar to what I've experienced with other corals as well."" – Renee Wiggins ""I love this colour.  I use a lot of Effetre coral and I'm really excited about using Phoenix instead.  I love the different tones, as shown in the pic of spacers."" – Julie Fountain ""When you first melt the rod of Phoenix in the flame and make a bead, the bead cools off to a beige color. When you reintroduce the bead into the flame, it starts to take on color and the first color that develops is peach. The more you heat the bead as you are working on it, the darker the coral becomes. You can super heat Phoenix throughout the beadmaking process to bring back the beige-peach color, but it works easiest if you make simple beads and only strike it once.  It takes practice to control the striking process and it doesn't always go the way you think it should - but that's what's fun about beadmaking!"" – Patricia Frantz Testers report that Phoenix rods often look different from batch to batch, but once worked they are a consistent hue. ""Got a new batch of CiM Phoenix in - and the rods look distinctly greyer than the original - but it is not labelled as an 'Unique' - CiM - for 'odd lot.' Unusual for CiM to not put a new product number on the colour if it is going to be different. So I thought I'd try it anyway. And the verdict is: if you strike it - the two batches are virtually indistinguishable. But if you don't - they are quite different.""

If you can add more pigment and they are not shocky, I think they would be good."" – Suzy Hannabuss ""I found the cloudy transparent glass to be much stiffer than other glass so it was a bit hard to sculpt with."" – Lori Peterson ""I had rods of cloudy transparent colors that were light as well as rods that were very dark. I made some beads with the dark rod of Watermelon and very little light came through the glass and the color was unappealing to me. However, the dark rod of Chocolate is a very nice brown. With such a huge difference between rods, I think it’s kind of a confusing sale if dark and light rods are presented as the same color."" – Gloria Sevey Many testers reported that our cloudy transparents were prone to shockiness or breakage. **Please pre-warm / pre-anneal rods accordingly.** ""In general, I have found the Cloudy Transparent colours to be a bit shocky. For the most part, this was quite manageable and well worth the effort, at least for the colours I've tried so far."" Read more at Melanie's blog . – Melanie Graham ""I experienced neither shockiness nor boiling with the cloudy transparents. I did use a cool flame though. I’ve changed my method of introducing glass rods to the flame which reduces shocking considerably [almost non-existent unless there are holes in the rod]. I rotate the tip of my rod way above the flame for a short time and then slowly rotate it downward into the flame. It’s usually starting to melt by that time. That said, not everyone uses this cautious of a method and might have rods being shocky because of being put into the flame when they’re still cold."" – Gloria Sevey ""In the new cloudy colors it does seem the thicker the rod the more saturated the color seems to be. I had zero issue with Heather, Morgan and Watermelon. However my beloved Pink Lemonade and Vintage Rose were super shocky even with kiln warming."" – Michelle  Veizaga ""Heather is a little shocky so a little pre-warming and careful introduction to the flame is all that’s needed. I’ve not had a lot of luck as Heather layered over Effetre White cracked [probably thermal] and when I tried over CiM Peace I got all sorts of crazy cracks. I found Chocolate a bit shocky, certainly more so than Watermelon which surprised me since they are both cloudy transparents and made in the same way. However pre-warming the rod seemed to help and the shocky-ness certainly wouldn’t put me off."" – Heather Johnson ""I agree with the mostly-too-shocky."" – Dwyn Tomlinson ""I made a clear base and encased with the cloudy transparents, but sadly the beads cracked."" – Trudi Doherty ""I experienced micro cracks when combining several of the cloudy transparents with 96 COE frit."" – Darlene Collette ""I didn’t have any problems with the cloudy transparents! They weren’t shocky or boiled, but I have to admit, that I work in a cold flame and very carefully to prevent any bad incident."" – Claudia Eidenbenz ""I found them intolerably shocky."" – Laurie Nessel ""I preheated all the testing rods in a Devardi rod warmer as it was particularly cold in the UK at that time and this is something I always do that time of year. By doing this I didn't experience any shockiness. I also used a very thin encasement of Effetre Superclear 006 before applying cloudy transparents as an encasement - no issues."" – Juliette Mullett ""I found the cloudy transparents shocky, that they boiled easily in the flame which created micro bubbles on the surface of beads, and that under clear encasement some of them cracked."" – Jolene Wolfe Some testers reported that our cloudy transparents were prone to boiling. ""I did find some cloudy transparents could boil if you worked them too hot. I like to work them cooler and with not too much oxygen in the flame."" – Trudi Doherty ""I had no issues with any of the cloudy transparents apart from a little bubbling in 1 or 2 of them."" – Juliette Mullett ""Another thing common to all of these colours [so far] is that they can be easy to boil, so you really have to watch your heat. This is true not only with fine stringer, but also when applying the glass from the rod to your bead. Work higher up in the flame and a bit cooler to avoid this problem."" Read more at Melanie's blog . – Melanie Graham Testers were divided on whether or not they liked the wispy or streaky quality of the cloudy transparents. ""All but two of the new color strands sold and the two that didn’t sell didn’t get much attention [Chocolate and Heather, both cloudy transparents]. I think that maybe those cloudy transparents just didn’t have enough zing to capture the mood hopes of this moment in time."" – Gloria Sevey ""There are lots of straight transparents. I'd vote for more cloudy transparents. If the glass is wispy then you can use those qualities to your advantage when making beads."" – Carol Ann Savage ""I loved the wispy/streaky quality, for me that was a big part of the attraction."" – Trudi Doherty ""I think the wispy/streaky quality is great for certain designs, but it's not something I prefer."" – Laurie Nessel ""I quite like the wispy quality, but I do like the more saturated streaks."" – Heather Johnson ""Some of my studio mates were unhappy with the color saturation in the cloudy transparents, particularly when making blown beads."" – Janet Evans ""I thought the wispiness was an upside. We have lots of solid colours and very few wispy ones. My opinion is that the wispiness is a plus and fills a gap."" – Melanie Graham","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=455,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511219WatermelonLtdRun.jpg,

CIM,351,Stone Ground,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Testers are divided on whether or not Stone Ground is significantly different from Effetre Opal Yellow. ""I tested Stone Ground & Opal Yellow under oxidation and without silver leaf, as well as rolled in silver leaf and in reduction. They are very similar to each other. Stone Ground has more yellow/brown tones, Opal Yellow has more yellow/orange tones."" – Bonnie Polinski ""It might be a fair generalization to say that the Opal Yellow tends to look a little lighter. In terms of reactivity and 'cool effects' - both of them react strongly - the Stone Ground possibly more so - perhaps just as it is a little darker. I'd say they are pretty comparable."" Read more and see comparison beads at DragonJools blog . – Dwyn Tomlinson ""Stone Ground gives more surface color variation when worked and it is a bit darker in general compared to Opal Yellow. I like the variation that I get from working Stone Ground on the surface. Opal Yellow stays a single color for me."" – Chris Haussler ""Stone Ground is less yellowy, and less reactive. I don't use it in place of Opal Yellow."" – Claire Morris ""I liked Stone Ground very much, but in comparing it to my current batch of Opal Yellow [which has the pink/peach center rings to the rods], I slightly preferred Opal Yellow. I found Cranberry Pink and rubino oro were  prettier on the Opal Yellow; they seemed to turn much darker on the Stone Ground, and the Stone Ground took on a beige tone when they were added."" – Donna Dorman ""They’re sort of siblings, somewhat the same but each holds its own pros and cons. The really ‘good’ Opal Yellow [pink rings inside] is more reactive than Stone Ground and has more colors to it. But the current Opal Yellow is a lot like Stone Ground."" – Elasia ""I don’t think of them as interchangeable colors. Each has its own unique qualities. Stone Ground makes a great base bead on which to decorate with other colors. It’s so neutral it almost disappears. If kept in the fire for a prolonged period, Stone Ground develops a darker more aged looking appearance that is really beautiful. I use lots of stringer decoration on Stone Ground and was delighted to see my stringers becoming attached to the base glass with having to melt them in, and none of them have had any issues with popping off."" – Gail Witt ""This is my very favorite color and I love using it with rubino and also Da Vinci. It is very lovely etched. I am able to bring out some darker hues as well as some pinks when worked a long time in the flame.  I prefer Stone Ground over Opal Yellow."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton ""Truthfully, I don’t see them as being comparable at all. I use the Italian OY for its reactive properties, and I use Stone Ground as an organic-looking base color."" – Kathy Coon ""I can't tell any difference. The color is nearly identical [if not identical] and it strikes the same."" – Elizabeth Long ""Stone Ground melts so much nicer [my OY is really shocky] and it seems to be more reactive with silver colors. I also noticed that it turns brown rather quickly while working and ends up being darker than OY."" – Lori Bergmann ""I use these mostly with silver glass or silver foil and I think they act about the same."" – Maija-Leena Autio ""I like Stone Ground for organics and with silver glasses. It is a little browner than OY. Raku gets more color on OY than Stone Ground."" – Pat O'Brien ""Stone Ground is very similar. I do like this earthy creamy yellow. I have not found it to react with silver foil in my tests."" – Renee Wiggins ""Stone Ground seems richer to me - Opal Yellow is a little washed out."" – Robin Aragon ""I love Stone Ground. It is a dead on match to Opal Yellow, yet easier to pull brownish hues from the glass with multiple striking in an ever so slight reduction flame."" – Starleen Colon ""Opal Yellow cannot be worked as long in the flame like Stone Ground. When working with Stone Ground I can get from white hot to a beautiful golden strike, every time! So I am able to play more with Stone Ground than with Opal Yellow."" – Vonna Maslanka Testers generally agreed that Stone Ground is easy to strike but difficult to reproduce the exact struck hues each time.

CIM,413,Peacock Green,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Peacock Green is a striking color. “Halong Bay, Peacock Green and Cirrus are my favorite CiM colours because of the way they can be worked to get the desired amount of opalness or translucency.” – Juliette Mullett Peacock Green does not etch in the same way as other 104 colors. Celia Friedman's tumble etching recipe for Peacock Green: ""Put your beads, a drop of dishwashing soap, a handful of small glass beads, and a spoonful of silicon carbide grit in a lapidary canister, add enough water to cover that plus a bit more, and tumble for 2-3 hours. Time and grit rating will determine the finished product. 1000 grit for two hours gives a smooth, subtle frost with a pearly gloss coming through, while 800 or 600 will give rougher results. The extra beads should be small, and many sources suggest 3-4 mm, but if you are tumbling large-hole beads those will get stuck in them, so I use mostly 6 mm. Tumbling doesn't texture glass inside grooves or depressions, so unless you like the artistic effect of a partially etched bead, it works best with evenly rounded or perfectly flat beads. Because dimpled hole ends don't etch, I make my tumbling beads with flat ends and dremel down the edges later. NOTE: once you put silicon grit in a canister you can never, ever use it, or anything you put in it, for polishing metal."" – Celia Friedman","""blue"", ""green""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=12,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511413PeacockGreen.jpg,
CIM,430,Elphaba,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Most testers reported that Elphaba is very close to (but in general is less reactive than) Effetre and Vetrofond’s pea greens. “The color is very similar to moretti pea green. I actually had a difficult time telling them apart on the bench but for rod diameter. I got less reaction effects than I typically get with moretti but a nice one with moretti petroleum green. Elphaba is a nice smooth glass not prone to reduction or pitting.” – Elise Swope “Elphaba is much easier to use, I think, because it doesn't spread like the other brands do, and you don't have to fight with a black line reaction. It's really nice to find a non reactive green!” – Evil Glass “Elphaba is a very nice lime green that doesn't swallow dots such as Moretti white M204. It is also not mushy like moretti pea green. It looks almost identical to pea green without all of the hassles.” – Genea Crivello “A lime green that is not much different than M-212 pea green.” – Leslie Anne Bitgood Some testers reported that Elphaba reduces to a brown or purple hue. “When Elphaba is reduced, I get shades of browns, blues, and purples.” – Elasia ""I used Elphaba with Kronos, and reduced, but Elphaba was unchanged.” – Teri Yount “When reduced, Elphaba gets a little darker – a bit on the brown side.” – Chris Molter “I tried reducing, I got nothing.” – Evil Glass Several testers remarked that Elphaba is particularly excellent for use as floral vines. “I used Elphaba with Moretti petroleum green which caused migration/ separation of the latter- a nice effect for vines & leaves.” – Elise Swope “Elphaba is easy to work with and very adaptable for stringers complex or single color. Mixes well with other greens, both transparents and pastels. I used it with Effetre Petroleum Green along with numerous other greens for complex stringers for floral vines.” – Sue Stewart “The first thing I noticed about Elphaba is that it is a bit firmer than Moretti pastel greens, making it a little easier to work with, especially when marving, pressing, and making twist cane with Elphaba and transparent colors.

CIM,482,Mojito,,,"CiM Tester Feedback In general, testers agree that Mojito is unique to the 104 glass color palette though at first glance it appears to be similar to apple green. ""It is light and delicate, but I do believe there is no other color quite like it."" – Serena Thomas ""At first I expected Mojito to be exactly the same as Effetre Pale Apple Green, but on comparison, they are very different. As you can see in the comparison pictures, Apple has more of a yellow-brown tint to it, while Mojito has more of a green-gray tint. Mojito is also darker/more saturated than Apple."" – Bethany Lemasters ""I have never seen a colour like this glass before! It is stunning!"" – Claire Morris ""Mojito is a nice light transparent yellow-green. I didn’t have another light green transparent to compare it to, so I used it in combination with an olive green in my colors. It is a very nice complimentary color to the olive. It could easily be used with greens or yellows."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton How does Mojito compare to Italian greens? ""Apple green had a lot of bubbles and just didn’t look clean and crisp to me. Mojito came out absolutely perfect – no imperfections at all. Also, the colors are a bit different. Mojito just looks better – a cleaner color, slightly lighter, and just looks a lot more subtle."" – Kathy Coon ""Mojito is somewhere in-between Apple and Kelp."" – Renee Wiggins ""Mojito and apple green are quite similar, Mojito is stiffer though. I think I will use it for the same purposes as apple green, in spacers and when I want to encase something with very light green."" – Maija-Leena Autio ""Mojito has a bit more color than Apple Green. It’s a slight difference but it makes a big difference if used to encase a bead or make stringer to apply as raised dots. I used Mojito as raised dots on Olive based beads and the color is really nice. The glass melted well and may be another possible transparent to use instead of clear when encasing beads."" – Gail Witt ""Pale Apple Green is a little lighter than Mojito. I also compared with Yellow Green and Kelp and noticed that Mojito is one of the more 'calmer' of the colors besides Kelp—meaning that it has a much lower tendency to bubble while working it. I really like this pale green and think it makes a wonderful compliment to Olive and Slytherin."" – Lori Bergmann ""Working with Mojito is very comparable to working with Italian apple green. It seems to be greyer and not as sprightly of a color. I prefer the Italian color wise."" – Chris Haussler ""Mojito seemed a bit paler than apple green, but very pretty."" – Donna Dorman ""Apple green and Mojito are a dead on match."" – Starleen Colon ""I would prefer Mojito myself over the Apple Green."" – Sue Stewart Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable (x2), Serena Thomas, & Bethany Lemasters for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=67,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511482mojito.jpg,
CIM,483,Slytherin,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Slytherin was engineered in response to many customer requests for a ""green Leaky Pen."" Slytherin is an extremely dark transparent green. ""This is a very dark color, so it's really not a good one for a thick base...even in a small spacer, Slytherin does not transmit a lot of light, making it appear black or intensely dark green."" – Kandice  Seeber ""Slytherin is a very dark green - like a transparent sage, but so dark - you'll need to dilute it. Work thin over white or clear, or pull into stringers. Not really a colour for single colour spacers!"" – Dwyn Tomlinson ""The intensity of this transparent colour makes the rods look virtually opaque."" – Jolene Wolfe ""Slytherin is a great dense green. The color is wonderful over white.  I especially like this color etched."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton Slytherin was designed to be dense enough to make leaf/vine cane, but testers were divided on whether or not we were successful in this goal. ""I really like Slytherin! It really does hold its own in leaf cane. I will be suggesting this glass in my tree bead tutorial."" – Claire Morris ""I like the idea of a dense green like Slytherin but not for twisties or leaf cane. It is the wrong tone or shade or something. I prefer to encase something like Olive or Commando in Oz for leaves or vines.  And I prefer Oz for twisties."" – Chris Haussler ""I loved the stiffness of Slytherin, and it made wonderful twisties."" – Donna Dorman ""I used Slytherin alone to make dots on the flowers in my Cranberry Pink bracelet [to the right].  Even as a tiny dot it shows off its pretty dark green color. Any other transparent green would have faded out to nothing. I made several twisties with Slytherin paired with Leaky Pen and Rubino.  Really gorgeous results."" – Gail Witt ""Slytherin is wonderful in twisties. Have mixed it with other greens and some browns to add visual interest when pulling leaf cane, and it really holds up well. Doesn’t get 'swallowed' by the other colors – it plays nicely with them all."" – Kathy Coon ""Slytherin is really dense on its own as a bead or layered over a lighter color, but when I tried making vine cane [Peacock Green with Slytherin stripes] it lost a lot of its vibrancy and looks like a washed out brownish green."" – Lori Bergmann ""I like that it has plenty of yellow in the green and is not too jewel like. It seems more natural in shades that you can pull from it. I like using this deep transparent over Khaki for a nice medium shade for leaf cane. But I found that if I didn’t liberally encase the Khaki, it was a little lighter than expected when pulled out."" – Marcy Lamberson ""Made a twisty with 2 stripes each of Olive, Elphaba, Split Pea, and Adamantium on a barrel of Slytherin. A perfect twisty for vines."" – Pat O'Brien ""To my surprise, Slytherin didn't work well for vine. It looks very dense in rod form, however when used it is not quite dark enough. I know, I know, it really shocked me."" – Starleen Colon ""Slytherin is nice but transparent Sage would still be my first choice for vines/leaves. It’s just a little darker/richer in my opinion."" – Sue Stewart Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable, Jolene Wolfe, Gail Witt, Sue Stewart, &  Maija-Leena Autio for the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=68,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511483Slytherin.jpg,

CIM,470,Eden,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Eden is extremely dense and an excellent substitute for our sold-out color Slytherin. It is especially useful for making vine cane. Eden is a really pretty green and will make a fabulous encasement layer for my vine canes . . . . From left to right, on top of Peppermint Cream, you see Slytherin Unique #2, Slytherin Unique #1, Algae, and Eden. Eden is a rich, evergreen green that is less yellow than the Slytherins and Algaes of the world. Read more at Melanie's blog . – Melanie Graham I usually use CiM Loch Ness to make my layered vine canes but find I like Eden even more! It is an emerald green colour when pulled down into stringer over a core of vibrant green Elphaba. – Jolene Wolfe I didn't get the aventurine to show, but I do like it for added element in my leaf cane. – Suzanne Cancilla-Fox Eden is a transparent green with aventurine. Testers had mixed feedback about the aventurine sparkle. Eden is a gorgeous dark green transparent. It has aventurine in it, and I can see on the CiM pages that other people have had some luck keeping the sparkle and even magnifying it under clear, but I haven't experienced that. Read more at Melanie's blog . – Melanie Graham ""This deep, mysterious color hides an array of depth. At first, I believed this color to be black, but on further inspection tones of greens and galaxy blue can be seen. The photographs do not do this glass justice... the golden glint of sparkle is much more apparent in person, especially when magnified by a clear encasement. The glass will react with aventurine frit. No shocking or bubbling occurred during testing."" – Heather Sellers Eden is a dark bottle green with sparkle inclusions. I really like this color. You can see the sparkle but it is subtle. It made a very nice base for silver glass but didn't seem overly reactive with it. – Caroline Davis I made several heavily encased-in-clear Eden beads and got hardly any sparkle. It's so fleeting that it can only be seen when the beads are moving.

CIM,508,Leaky Pen,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Leaky Pen is a dense and saturated blue that is unique to the 104 palette. ""Leaky Pen is such a saturated and gorgeous color - and I really love that about it. It doesn't fade out when used with lighter opaques - like many of the dark transparents in 104 COE glasses tend to. I also love that Leaky Pen is not a color that is close to anything else in the same COE - it's a brand new shade."" – Kandice  Seeber “This is my favorite of all Messy Colors. I love intense transparents that I can use layered over white to make encased beads. This color holds up to making designs over white.” – Gail Witt “To get the blue color to look anything but black, I found that I had to put it over another color. I liked it over both white and clear. When placed over a white core, the bead took on an opaque multi-toned midnight blue color. When placed over clear, the bead became more transparent.” – Jan Whitesel-Keeton “Silver glass loves Leaky Pen! It is very dense and needs to be thinned out by applying over a lighter color.” – Janice Laster Some testers reported Leaky Pen ""boiling,"" ""scumming,"" or ""sparkling."" “Leaky Pen boiled probably once out of A LOT of rods.” – Elasia “Like most blue colors, I had to work it really cool, or it would boil. I had to take my time but the results were worth it!” – Gail Witt “Since I turned down my flame considerably, I don’t seem to have a problem with boiling or scum.” – Jan Whitesel-Keeton “I think I have run across this issue with Leaky Pen, but to me, this is more of an issue of learning the techniques of working with CiM glass in general. I find that you need to warm CiM colors more carefully to avoid the cracking, boiling. Even though I have observed bubbling and frothing, I find it’s from working the glass too hot. When I move it out a little further, the issue resolves. CiM seems to need to work just a smidgen ‘cooler’.” – Jennifer Borek “My experience with Leaky Pen is that it likes to be treated on the gentle side, not using lots of heat.  I have found with Leaky Pen if it does boil, I can cool and gently re-heat and it will lose the bubbles/pitting.” – Leslie Anne Bitgood “Leaky Pen has boiled for me and is somewhat temperamental at first, but it will settle down after it gets melted in the bead. Sometimes it is difficult to pull stringers because it boils, but I know once it gets on the bead or murrini gather, it'll smooth out.” – Renee Wiggins ""It doesn't bubble, and melts very smoothly."" – Kandice  Seeber ""If you are having problems with Leaky Pen, use an oxidizing flame. That will keep the sparklies down. The sparkle spots didn't affect my finished beads. They still have a nice smooth texture."" – Genea Crivello ""I had great luck with Leaky Pen, but I worked in a cooler flame."" – Donna Dorman Special thanks to Debora Cox, Teri Wathan, Kimberly Affleck, Elasia, Maija-Leena Autio,  Genea Crivello-Knable, & Carol Oliver for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=11,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511508LeakyPen.jpg,
CIM,512,Halong Bay,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Halong Bay is a striking color. “Halong Bay, Peacock Green and Cirrus are my favorite CiM colours because of the way they can be worked to get the desired amount of opalness or translucency.” – Juliette Mullett Halong Bay does not etch in the same way as other 104 colors. Celia Friedman's tumble etching recipe for Halong Bay: ""Put your beads, a drop of dishwashing soap, a handful of small glass beads, and a spoonful of silicon carbide grit in a lapidary canister, add enough water to cover that plus a bit more, and tumble for 2-3 hours. Time and grit rating will determine the finished product. 1000 grit for two hours gives a smooth, subtle frost with a pearly gloss coming through, while 800 or 600 will give rougher results. The extra beads should be small, and many sources suggest 3-4 mm, but if you are tumbling large-hole beads those will get stuck in them, so I use mostly 6 mm. Tumbling doesn't texture glass inside grooves or depressions, so unless you like the artistic effect of a partially etched bead, it works best with evenly rounded or perfectly flat beads. Because dimpled hole ends don't etch, I make my tumbling beads with flat ends and dremel down the edges later. NOTE: once you put silicon grit in a canister you can never, ever use it, or anything you put in it, for polishing metal."" – Celia Friedman","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=13,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511512HalongBay.jpg,
CIM,531,Lapis,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Lapis is a unique addition to the 104 lampworking palette. ""I swear it's like an opaque ink blue. A deep purple blue. It's not as blue as the effetre Lapis which is more cobalty.” – Kevan Aponte “Lapis is a very dark purple blue. There really isn't much comparison in the Moretti palette.” – Genea Crivello “I really love this deep dark purple. If I could make an opaque version of dark ink blue it would look just like this! There hasn’t been any opaque purple this dark, so it’s a great addition to my palette.” – Gail Witt Lapis is very dark. “It can get really dark – almost black after working it for awhile.” – Chris Molter ""It’s quite dark, which presents a design challenge for me. I find the darker colors harder to work with. This is a glass I would use as frit, more than rod."" – Terri Budrow-Nelson “It is not so dark that it looks black, but is a really dark purple."" – Gail Witt Some testers reported a metallic sheen when reducing Lapis. ""I would compare Messy Lapis to Moretti’s hand pulled dark silver plum. It reacts much the same way as the dark silver plum in reduction but is more blue, and is not overpowered by the ‘reduced silver surface' that the silver plum gets in reduction. Though I love dark silver plum, I am sometimes disappointed that the reduction overpowers the color so heavily. I love Lapis’ ability to get the silvered reduction surface while still retaining its rich blue/indigo color!"" – Bonnie Polinski “I tried reducing it – I found no difference."" – Chris Molter ""I did reduce the glass on a small bead, but didn’t see a lot of change."" – Gail Witt ""If worked long, or reduced, a silver sheen comes out."" – Elasia Some testers suggested that Lapis should be in the purple category instead of blue. ""I think this is one of those colors that you should put under both the blue AND the purple, because it really does go both ways.

""The Effetre Turquoise opalinos, the closest colors to Electric Avenue, are much shockier and much easier to burn/scum/boil than Electric Avenue."" – Carol Oliver ""I found this color very easy to work. No pitting, boiling, cracking."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood ""I had no issues working with Electric Avenue, but I recommend annealing high as extra insurance."" – Starleen Colon ""Nothing even close to the problems of working with Opalinos. Electric Avenue was easy to work and nothing adverse like devitrifying or as I call it, 'self etching.'"" – Sue Stewart ""Electric Avenue isn't as shocky as the Moretti opalinos."" – Teri Yount “I did not find Electric Avenue difficult to work with. But, should one want to keep the glass from reducing, there would be a learning curve.” – Bonnie Polinski “I’ve stayed away from trying opalinos before, because of their bad reputation. But I love all the CiM opals and haven’t experienced any of the problems as with other brands.” – Lori Bergmann Testers generally agreed that encasing Electric Avenue, or using it on a clear base, or working it fast, resulted in more opalescence. ""Electric Avenue stayed opalescent. I worked it for about 20 minutes on my HH in the center of the flame. I super heated it in order to spread the twistie I applied, and this did not seem to affect the opalescence."" – Bonnie Polinski ""By itself in a bead, Electric Avenue stayed opalescent on the outside while appearing more opaque on the inside. When used on a base of another color, Electric Avenue became a more opaque turquoise glass with or without encasing."" – Carol Oliver ""I think the longer and hotter that you work Electric Avenue the more opaque it seems to become. I've put it over a base of clear and it glows."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood ""I only got opaque from this color, regardless of working time."" – Teri Yount ""It never seems like an opalescent to me, more like a creamy opaque. But it does layer over other opaque colors and shows more transparency then. It became more opaque and darker the more I worked it. The faster I finished with a bead and the less heat used, the more translucent and lighter it was, compared to a darker color if I had to use a lot of heat and/or work it longer in a design."" – Lori Bergmann ""In solid beadwork, less opal. Encase, opal shines, encase deep and it sings translucent!"" – Starleen Colon ""Electric Avenue worked out to almost the same opalescence as exhibited by the rod. Opal like but there is no mystery to it like so many of the Opalino glasses."" – Sue Stewart Testers report that Electric Avenue shifts in color depending on the type of lighting. Testers report that Electric Avenue is difficult to photograph. ""Electric Avenue was very, very hard to photograph. It tends to look a bit washed out and dirty in most pictures . . . which I suspect has something to do with the translucency. Looking at the CiM website, I see I am not alone on this issue. In real life, Electric Avenue is more saturated than can be shown here.""

CIM,550,Chalcedony,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Testers agreed that Chalcedony is unique to the 104 glass lampworking palette. “It’s a gorgeous color that I haven’t seen anywhere else! It seems closest to regular Periwinkle, but I love the dreamy character it has.” – Jan Whitesel-Keeton “There are a couple of colors that are similar, Effetre Pajama Blue for one, but nothing really comes that close to its color, ease of use and workability.” – Starleen Colon “Chalcedony has more depth than Effetre or Vetrofond Periwinkle blue but may ‘frazzle’ when worked in higher heat.” – Carol Oliver “Chalcedony isn't as shocky and is a little darker than Moretti's equivalent color.” – Teri Yount “No other colors compare.” – Sue Stewart Testers found this opal easy to work. “Effetre’s opalinos are very shocky and burn/boil easily; neither of these were a problem with Messy Chalcedony.” – Carol Oliver “I had no issues if annealed high, no devit and no cracking.” – Starleen Colon “Effetre’s opalinos are very stiff and hard to work without heating the snot out of them which can affect the finished piece. They boil, devit, change colors, and some are hard if not impossible to encase. Messy’s new opal like colors including Chalcedony don’t do that at all. I like that you can control the opal effect, going opaque to opaly depending on how you work it. I like the fact that they don’t devitrify and get that ‘dry,’ over cooked look. I’ve been able to encase most of them without incident.” – Sue Stewart Testers generally agreed that encasing Chalcedony, or using it on a clear base, or working it fast & cool, resulted in more opalescence. “Chalcedony stayed opalescent when working, but stayed opaque enough to maintain its color over a transparent glass. It did tend to frazzle out when hot and spreading was noted on transparent glass.” – Carol Oliver “For the most part, Chalcedony kept the same translucent quality, no matter how long or hot I worked it.” – Lori Bergmann “It does not seem to be an opalescent in my opinion, more solid.” – Starleen Colon “I’ve made Chalcedony both stay opalescent and turn opaque. The working temp and the amount of manipulation seem to play the major role in controlling the end result. Yes, Chalcedony likes cooler temps and less work to get the opalino look but . . . there is nothing really wrong with going to the opaque side.” – Sue Stewart “Chalcedony tends to stay opaque.” – Teri Yount “Chalcedony can be semi translucent or opaque depending on the amount of work in the flame.” – Jan Whitesel-Keeton Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable & Teri Wathan for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=37,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511550Chalcedony.jpg,
CIM,563,Pulsar,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Most testers reported that Pulsar is slightly more intense than the Italian aquas.

Side by side, Pulsar is much more vibrant."" – Elasia ""I tested Pulsar, Effetre 034 aquamarine, Effetre 036 dark aqua, and Lauscha aqua. All these colors were sparky and had to be worked very cool.

This reaction then kinda works its way out—it eventually stops doing it and I can continue to heat and reheat the glass as much as I want. If I manipulate the glass in any way—with a graphite marver, a brass press, tweezers—the glass will begin to boil again wherever it has been touched with the tool. I actually had some of the same problems with Effetre dark aqua, but not to the extent that I have with Pulsar.” – Bethany Lemasters “I work in a cooler flame. Pulsar is a gorgeous clear deep aqua blue with no bubbles.” – Donna Dorman “Pulsar was fine once my dirty gas was fixed.” – Elasia “Since I turned down my flame considerably, I don’t seem to have a problem with boiling or scum.” – Jan Whitesel-Keeton “I've always had trouble with 'boiling' aquas...both light and dark Effetre drive me nuts. Pulsar has a slight bubbly tendency but it can be tamed with a cooler, oxygenated flame, and whatever surface bubbles form will even out.” – Karen  Sherwood “My experience with Pulsar is that it likes to be treated on the gentle side, not using lots of heat.” – Leslie Anne Bitgood “I prefer ALL of the CiM turquoise family colors to the Italian colors simply because they melt so much better and smoother. Occasionally I will find them bubbling on the surface, but for me, keeping the glass a little higher in the flame works like a charm.” – Renee Wiggins ""Pulsar boils a bit easier for me than the Italian aquas. Nice color, just a bit temperamental."" – Chris Haussler Some testers reported problems with Pulsar pitting. ""Recently I had an issue with Pulsar & Azure pitting and bubbling when too much heat was applied. The hose and my equipment were relatively new, and there was nothing about the flame to suggest contamination, but when I switched out the hose the problem started going away.

CIM,568,Fremen,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Testers disagreed on how Fremen compared to Italian Sky Blue. ""I really dislike Fremen, it is way too reactive. I wanted to use this in my tree beads but couldn't as it made a grey mess!"" – Claire Morris ""I found sky blue boiled easier, but was stiffer and had a more pure color in the bead. The Fremen beads had striations in them that I didn’t care for as much. I prefer the true solid color of sky blue."" – Donna Dorman ""Sky blue does ‘play’ more if you like that sort of thing but it really went down hill the past few batches. Italian = shocky and full of black specks inside."" – Elasia ""I made beads for a bracelet with half of them made with Fremen and the others with light Sky Blue, and I can’t see any difference in the two colors. There may be a little more of the darker blue lines that appear from winding the glass with the Fremen, but I don’t mind that. Other than that I didn’t find any difference between the two colors."" – Gail Witt ""Fremen and Sky Blue are pretty much identical in color and consistency when melted, although the rods look slightly different. They both turn red when reduced, but seems like Fremen was slightly less quick to change than Sky Blue. When I put Peace dots on both, the dots were more crisp and brighter looking on the Fremen as well."" – Lori Bergmann ""Effetre 224 / 228 and Fremen reacted with dark ivory as turquoise. Darker the shade, darker and sharper the black/gray line between blue and ivory. When reduced strongly, all glasses reduced to brick red."" – Maija-Leena Autio ""The Italian sky blue seems a little more pale and opaque. Fremen seems to have more lines in it and is not as smooth of a color. Acts more like a light turquoise, instead of the sky blue. However, it doesn’t seem to turn red quickly when too close to the cones, the way the sky blue does."" – Marcy Lamberson Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable, Maija-Leena Autio, Leslie Anne Bitgood, & Pat O'Brien for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=52,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511568Fremen.jpg,
CIM,569,Smurfy,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Most testers agree that Smurfy is comparable to Italian Turquoise minus the metallic / silvering effect. ""Smurfy is a lovely color. It does seem to work a bit easier with a decreased tendency to go metallic. The reaction with other colors like Ivory seems to be a bit more subtle which I like. Used as a stinger for fine work, Fremen and Smurfy beat the Italian glasses hands down. They don’t melt into the surface as easily as the Italian versions. The Italian versions seem 'soft'."" – Chris Haussler ""Smurfy is wonderful to melt, but thought turquoise was a bit brighter, prettier color. That said, I still wouldn’t hesitate to use Smurfy – the difference is subtle."" – Donna Dorman ""It’s nice to not have a turquiose I have to worry about turning silver when I don’t want it to."" – Elasia ""Smurfy has more striation than Italian turquoise which I like. This effect gives a bit of detail without having to provide a lot of extra effort."" – Elizabeth Long ""I used Smurfy and turquoise in several tests and found that they pretty much acted the same. On an Ivory base bead I placed dots of each color on opposite sides of the bead. At first glance there is no difference. If the bead is placed in bright light it is apparent that the Smurfy is a much bluer color. I still get the dark rings around each dot, which happens with Italian turquoise, and can be an important part of the design."" – Gail Witt ""It doesn’t devit or get an ugly grey surface like Italian turquoise does – that’s a major plus!"" – Kathy Coon ""Smurfy and turquoise are nearly identical in color and consistency, with Smurfy being just ever so slightly paler in color. Both reduced to a coppery red and got grey smutz if exposed to too much propane in the flame."" – Lori Bergmann ""Smurfy is a shade between light and dark turquoise Effetre 232 and 236 and behaves quite similarly to them. Italians are a little bit streakier. All the glasses react quite similarly to dark ivory, reaction is a bit stronger darker the shade. When reduced strongly, all glasses reduced to brick red."" – Maija-Leena Autio ""I love Smurfy. The color is a little different and it doesn’t turn gray as easily."" – Marcy Lamberson ""Smurfy is a really nice medium turquoise [but a little more blue] that isn't so prone to the weird metallic devit the Italian turquoises seem to give. I would like to see Smurfy just a tad more to the green side, because it's not quite as strong of a turquoise color as I'd like to see."" – Renee Wiggins ""Smurfy is slightly more blue than a true turquoise tone."" – Starleen Colon ""Smurfy does not give the 'orangey' discoloration as Effetre turquoise does which is good."" – Sue Stewart ""This is the perfect replacement for Dark Turquoise! It melts nicely, can stand heat in a neutral flame, and presses well with no silvering after chilling and reheating. This color is just so amazingly brilliant."" – Genea Crivello ""It is the unpleasant dirtiness that Effetre Dark Sky Blue and Dark Turquoise acquire in the flame that makes me prefer CiM Fremen and CiM Smurfy when I'm looking for a turquoise that is in this hue range. The CiM colours don't do this icky thing."" – Melanie Graham Smurfy is darker than both Light Turquoise and Fremen, more of a shade with Dark Sky Blue. Unlike Dark Sky Blue, it doesn't easily develop that grey sheen, although you can make it happen if you hold it in a reducing flame.

CIM,571,Cornflower,,,"CiM Tester Feedback We asked our testers to compare Ming [an opal] and Cornflower [an opaque] to Italian lapis. ""I have used both Ming & Cornflower cannot tell the difference between the two except in price. The Ming is pricier and that would push me to the Cornflower. I think the colors are more consistent than the Italian glasses and don’t show the variation in batches that I see with the Italians."" – Chris Haussler ""I don't think you can compare them to each other as one is opaque and one opal. Both are different to Lapis in my opinion. I LOVED Ming, I loved its opalness - and when I put it with silver glasses it got a lovely secondary fuming. Cornflower is more vibrant than Lapis."" – Claire Morris ""I don’t have a preference for either Ming or Cornflower. I’ll always reach for French Blue instead. It’s the best!"" – Donna Dorman ""I know a lot of people are afraid of opals like Ming, but Messy opals are a different beast to me, so much less shocky and user friendly compared to Italian opals. Cornflower is almost exactly the same as med. Lapis, but med. Lapis became so shocky. Even though med. Lapis was a favorite of mine, I stopped buying it."" – Elasia ""I really like Cornflower because of its opacity. I’m also a blue lover, and the intensity of this color really sings."" – Gail Witt ""Ming and Cornflower are so alike that I couldn’t tell them apart. Both seemed to work about the same."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton ""I prefer Cornflower, as it is lower priced than Ming. Both are brighter and crisper than the Italian lapis."" – Kathy Coon ""Both melted very nicely, but Cornflower seems to be a tiny bit stiffer than Ming. The spacers I made looked almost identical. You can see the tiniest bit of cloudiness in the Ming, but only if you look for it. To me, Ming doesn’t have that same inner 'glow' as your other opals like Kryptonite."" – Lori Bergmann ""For me, I do like the semi-opaque quality of Ming. It's a very pure medium lapis color that catches the light in a unique way. It's somewhere in between Cornflower and French Blue. Cornflower is very similar to the Italian Lapis glass, same density and hue, and for me they are interchangeable."" – Renee Wiggins ""We already have multiple opaque lapis hues similar to Cornflower to select from. But Ming can be diluted down to produce milky hues / color ranges in a unique opal. It is different from anything else out there."" – Starleen Colon ""I don’t think that you can compare either Ming or Cornflower to Effetre Lapis.

CIM,632,Thai Orchid,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Thai Orchid is a unique addition to the 104 lampworking palette. “It is a nice addition to the purple color palette in our industry. It’s dark enough not to be brown and purple enough not to be red. It’s PURPLE. A beautiful and very welcome addition to the purples that are already out there.” – Sue Stewart “A luscious orchid! Nothing in the Moretti palette to compare.” – Leslie Anne Bitgood “A true opaque purple, without the problems that come with so many.” – Elise Swope “It doesn't have a brown undertone! Yay! I made one bead with both colors...and you could really see the brown colors in the moretti purples, and not in the Thai Orchid.” – Evil Glass “It’s close to other 104 violets, but more intense, more purple. Better.” – Terri Budrow-Nelson Thai Orchid is very dark. “It’s hard to photograph! This color and Lapis are so dark they appear almost black in photos.” – Gail Witt “This one just stays purple. It is maybe on the dark side but it stays true to the rod color. It definitely is a WYSIWYG color as seems to be the case with the entire CiM line.” – Sue Stewart Some testers reported a metallic sheen when reducing Thai Orchid. ""I noticed a metallic sheen when working too close to the torch head or when in a reduction flame.” – Tina Lamasney “I reduced it several times and didn’t see any change.” – Gail Witt “I fried, reduced, cooled, reduced and got no reaction.” – Leslie Anne Bitgood “I didn’t reduce much, but Vonna did. Thai Orchid began to acquire a silvered look in a reduction flame. Most of the silver look burned back off when I changed to a neutral or slight oxidizing flame.” – Bonnie Polinski “It gets silver when worked for a long period of time.” – Genea Crivello “I noticed a metallic sheen when working, but it wasn't there when not hot.” – Evil Glass We asked our testers to compare Grape Ape, Evil Queen, Poi, & Thai Orchid. ""I had a tough time with all of these purples because they all looked the same to me. Poi is lighter in color, but it is relatively close to Effetre violet, so then you have the price thing to consider. Evil Queen isn't a bad purple, but my complaint about it is just that it is too dark. Grape Ape striated a lot."" – Bethany Lemasters ""All these purples look fairly similar when made into spacers. But I like Evil Queen because it is a slightly brighter purple. It’s a toss-up between Poi and Thai Orchid because they both got great reactions when used over Hades, so I think they can do some neat effects."" – Lori Bergmann ""Poi is my favorite."" – Sue Stewart ""Evil Queen is the best of the bunch even though it is expensive. Poi is my favorite when encased due to lines of deeper purple that develop. Thai Orchid is my favorite for pulling out a deep silver luster."" – Starleen Colon ""For me, I find Grape Ape, Poi and Thai Orchid to be very similar in hue, but with different densities. They definitely have their place in the current palette of purples, but they are very similar. Evil Queen is a very nice medium purple and would get my vote for my favorite of the four. I think Evil Queen is a better neutral medium purple than the Italian colors."" – Renee Wiggins ""Grape Ape sometimes has a dirty look to it. Evil Queen can work for flowers if put over Peace. Poi is kinda washed out looking. Thai Orchid is my favorite, dark and opaque."" – Pat O'Brien ""Evil Queen seems too close to Moretti in a shade that is less interesting to me. I like Thai Orchid the best. It’s a very rich, pure and dark purple that doesn’t seem to have any gray or other colors in it."" – Marcy Lamberson ""If I have to choose, I guess Grape Ape is my favorite because it seems to be the darkest."" – Maija-Leena Autio ""Evil Queen is hands-down my fav, but it costs quite a bit more, so I generally try to make use of one of the lower priced purples, usually Grape Ape."" – Kathy Coon ""I love Grape Ape because it really is a grapey purple opaque. This color fills a hole in the glass palette. I definitely like Evil Queen the best as it is the most opaque. Poi has a lot of gray tone to it. Thai Orchid is my second favorite of the CiM purples. It’s a bit on the grey side, but is nicely opaque and is easy to use. It melts well and makes a great base bead color."" – Gail Witt ""I like Evil Queen the best because it is a more true purple. The others have a touch of gray."" – Elizabeth Long ""Grape Ape is my favorite. Evil Queen is equivalent to 272 violet to me but more purple than gray, and more lavender than Thai Orchid. Poi is a great purple, I like it. Thai Orchid is a true dark purple to me and I like the reactions with silver glasses."" – Elasia ""To me, they are all virtually indistinguishable. I put them all side by side on mandrels, and even under an Ott light it was virtually impossible to see any differences. Two other lampworkers looked at the beads as well, and they saw no difference in them either. The only one a bit different was Evil Queen: it is slightly prettier, a bit purpleier, but considering it’s over 3 times the price of Grape Ape, I don’t see any way to justify the cost difference."" – Donna Dorman ""Thai Orchid is my favorite - I just like the colour the best!"" – Claire Morris ""Grape Ape is one of my favorites. Love the color and how it works. Evil Queen is a favorite of some of my customers. Can’t seem to make anything that I like with Poi. Love how Thai Orchid works but it does get a bit metallic at times."" – Chris Haussler ""I really love Grape Ape. I also think it has nicer working properties [it's firmer and easier for me to work with] at the torch than E Violet. Grape Ape has a richer and deeper color saturation and does not seem to get as dirty as E Violet does.

CIM,703,Butter Pecan,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Butter Pecan is an excellent neutral base color. “Butter Pecan is good as a replacement for ivory if you don't want dark lines with reactive colors.” – Chris Molter “I used it with several 96 frits, got less reaction than I get with ivory.” – Evil Glass “This color is fairly nondescript, it is somewhat of an ivory, somewhat of a tan, it doesn't react with anything I used with it, so it isn't an exciting color. Some of the darker colors, like Bordello seem to ""sink"" into it, as if it were softer. That blurs the interface between the two colors. ” – Tim Gottleber ""This seems to be a nice glass to work with, as it gives a different shade to the 'ivory' category for me. It does have the streakiness of the ivories, so would work well with something you didn’t want an antiqued look too. I was hoping the finished glass would have the pearl look that the rod has, but was not able to achieve this.” – Jan Whitesel-Keeton Although Butter Pecan is, in general, a non reactive glass, some Messy Color testers reported occasional reactions. “Butter Pecan’s reaction with Celadon is one of my favorites of this glass line. I make a lot of floral beads and use this reaction to add interest to my beads. I also love how this glass can be used as an alternate to white . . . a bit warmer so it makes a great background color.” – Gail Witt Special thanks to Gail Witt & Trudi Doherty for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=5,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511703ButterPecan.jpg,

If you like that it is great; on the other hand, if you want defined edges on dots and lines, it can be a problem.” – Tim Gottleber Ginger is an excellent neutral base color. “This color often looks like Butter Pecan. It’s a little bit warmer in tone and makes a great base color.” – Gail Witt “I loved working with the Ginger and using it with reactive frits. It makes the most beautiful organic beads. It etches, presses well, marvers well, isn’t shocky, melts smooth, and is lovely to work with."" – Janice Laster “WOW! What a versatile color! I absolutely love working with Ginger. It is such a wonderful base or surface decoration. It ranges from a flesh tone to beige. It looks great with everything."" – Stephanie Risberg Some Messy Color testers described Ginger as “streaky,” but only if overworked. “It is a little streaky but the color is so light it doesn’t show up too much.” – Gail Witt “It is sometimes streaky. But that adds to its charm. Some beads had no streaks whatsoever while others had lots of streaks. I thought it might be the graphite marver, but only ½ the beads that I marvered had streaks.” – Stephanie Risberg Ginger does not change when reduced. “I did not notice any change in appearance when reduced.” – Stephanie Risberg “There was no reaction with either reduction or oxidation.” – Tim Gottleber Special thanks to Evil Glass, Teri Wathan, Jolene Wolfe, & Trudi Doherty for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=8,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511701Ginger.jpg,

CIM,728,Canoe,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Canoe is a unique addition to the 104 lampworking palette. Canoe is a warm, toasted chestnut. The glass features a blush of russet when worked with a cool tool.

A lovely and unique addition to the 104 palette. – Heather Sellers The closest colour to Canoe is Stone Ground which is a more reactive colour and you can see on here how the silvered ivory band is narrower . . . the Stone Ground has 'swallowed' some of this. – Trudi Doherty ""Here is Canoe with Kugler Beadmaking 104 Silver Petrol [previously known as ASK Silver Rattan], CiM Pumpkin Unique #1, ASK Caramel Apple [now known as Iris Savanne], Kugler Silver Brown [previously known as ASK Silver Cinnamon], and CiM Stone Ground.

CIM,806,Cirrus,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Cirrus is a moonstone. “Halong Bay, Peacock Green and Cirrus are my favorite CiM colours [Note from CiM: all 3 are moonstones] because of the way they can be worked to get the desired amount of opalness or translucency.” – Juliette Mullett Cirrus is etch resistant. ""Like Peacock Green and Halong Bay, Cirrus can't be etched with acid [trust me, I left some in an acid bath for six hours, and at best you get spotty damage] but it can be tumbled to a 'sea glass' finish in a lapidary tumbler. The result is identical to etched clear glass in terms of opacity, but the subtle blue tone gives it an especially brilliant whiteness."" – Celia Friedman Celia Friedman's tumble etching recipe for Cirrus: ""Put your beads, a drop of dishwashing soap, a handful of small glass beads, and a spoonful of silicon carbide grit in a lapidary canister, add enough water to cover that plus a bit more, and tumble for 2-3 hours. Time and grit rating will determine the finished product. 1000 grit for two hours gives a smooth, subtle frost with a pearly gloss coming through, while 800 or 600 will give rougher results. The extra beads should be small, and many sources suggest 3-4 mm, but if you are tumbling large-hole beads those will get stuck in them, so I use mostly 6 mm. Tumbling doesn't texture glass inside grooves or depressions, so unless you like the artistic effect of a partially etched bead, it works best with evenly rounded or perfectly flat beads. Because dimpled hole ends don't etch, I make my tumbling beads with flat ends and dremel down the edges later.  NOTE: once you put silicon grit in a canister you can never, ever use it, or anything you put in it, for polishing metal."" – Celia Friedman Special thanks to Genea Crivello, Suzy Hannabuss, Teri Wathan, Elasia, & Vonna Maslanka for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=3,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511806Cirrus.jpg,
CIM,820,Hades,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Hades has become the “go to” black for many lampworkers. ""Hades is the best black! I love it. It is the only black, that's really black, without the unpleasant side effects such as devitrification or silver shimmer."" – Angela Hadorn “This is the only black I use, it covers ALL the different blacks for me, great for ‘just black’ [i.e. not purple like Effetre etc.], for webbing [i.e. intense black], for great reactions with silver foil, leaf and glasses.” – Elasia “I do use Hades as I like how it stays black; I mostly use it as stringer. I tend to use Effetre black for basic stuff and Hades when it really matters.” – Julie Fountain “Hades is my favorite real black.” – Maija-Leena Autio “Tuxedo is my staple black, because of the price difference from Hades. I love Hades as well, but tend to save it for more special applications.” – Donna Dorman “I use Hades all the time and think it is the best black on the market.” – Gail Witt “I prefer Hades to other blacks.” – Jan Whitesel-Keeton ""It is always on the bench when I am working."" – Chris Haussler “I use this black the most out of any of the blacks on the market. It's more affordable, extremely dense, and doesn't bleed out in my murrini, and it's very neutral in tone. I do like that it can give similar effects as the Italian dense black by ‘webbing’, so for me this glass is ideal and has the best of both worlds.” – Renee Wiggins ""Hades does not give you the purple color on white that other blacks have. Hades and silver foil make other silver glasses do amazing things!"" – Tina Lamasney “Hades is my most-often used black, unless I’m using it as filler or someplace not visible, and then I use the less expensive Vetrofond or Effetre Black.” – Kathy Coon What is the difference between Hades & Tuxedo? Hades is our intense black (will maintain its black color even when pulled into stringer) and Tuxedo is our regular black (less dense). “Hades is definitely more black than Tuxedo. It’s like a ‘premium’ black.” – Laura Sparling ""To me, Hades is a richer, jet black, while Tuxedo looks the same in a solid bead, but when used as decoration like dots or stringer work, it can look a little less saturated black."" – Lori Bergmann ""I consider Tuxedo to be a staple and Hades to be a special glass."" – Jolene Wolfe ""For me, Hades is a 'true' black and Tuxedo is a very deep grey. Both Tuxedo & Hades will get a bit squirrelly with enough heat."" – Chris Haussler ""Hades is denser than Tuxedo. Hades is a nice true black that doesn’t bleed purple."" – Teri Yount ""Hades acts more like intense black and it stays black. Tuxedo is black but can go grey on white etc. Hades, when blown or made into a hollow or pulled into a stringer, stays black, not purple."" – Elasia ""If you melt Hades into white the resulting line will appear black. If you do the same test with Tuxedo, the line appears more purple. I would definitely describe Hades as a real, true dense black. It is the only black I will use from now on."" – Gail Witt ""Hades webs and Tuxedo does equally as much."" – Pat O'Brien How does Hades compare to Effetre intense black? Testers reported that they prefer Hades because of its spectacular reactions with silver and its stiffness. ""Hades is easier to control than Effetre intense black, and will reduce in the presence of silver which Effetre intense black will not do."" – Carol Oliver ""Hades is stiffer and easier to control when working as a stringer."" – Claire Morris ""Both are ‘proper’ black instead of really dark purple or blue or whatever, I chose between the two based on how reactive they are with other colors. Hades does wonderful things with many of the silver or reactive glasses, and has great movement when you want it to spread or web. Hades does everything that Intense Black does, plus it is more color reactive with silver glass, costs less and is much more consistent from batch to batch."" – Kathy Coon ""Hades is a more intense black than the Effetre intense black. Hades = Blackgasm. Effetre intense black = dark black. The Effetre will spread and spread whereas the Hades will stay put and behave itself. Hades has a bright glossier shine to it when compared to Effetre, I really like it! The only problem with Hades is that I couldn't see the details as easily as with Effetre. This was due to not getting the dreaded metallic sheen. I did bump my light up a bit and that took care of the problem."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood ""Hades and Effetre intense black are about the same. But Hades works great with silver glass and Effetre intense black doesn’t."" – Pat O'Brien ""I have only ever used Effetre intense black as fine stringer for lace/web beads – I find that they both behave very similarly for this purpose. Hades tends to be more affordable and also easier to source in the UK."" – Jolene Wolfe ""Hades maintains its crispness better than Intense Black. I work Hades very cool when using it as stringer and it keeps its definition that way."" – Laura Sparling ""Hades can take more heat before webbing. That might give it an edge in some situations."" – Chris Haussler ""Hades is a beautiful reactive black. It is even more dense than Tuxedo but doesn't web like intense black. It can sometimes get a bluish shimmer when used with silver or with silver glass."" – Caroline Davis Most testers agreed that Hades is a bit stiffer than the Italian blacks. ""Hades is stiffer, but if it is too hot, it behaves much like intense black."" – Angela Hadorn ""I loved the way it webs like intense black does, but the fact that it is stiffer makes all the difference for me. I really like this glass a lot."" – Claire Morris ""Hades is more stiff which makes it easier to use for a stringer decoration."" – Gail Witt ""If there is a difference, I can’t tell."" – Chris Haussler ""Hades was VERY easy to sculpt with; it wasn't as stiff as I thought it was going to be."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood ""Hades being stiffer makes it a great color to pull into stringer and to rake with."" – Bonnie Polinski ""I find them to be very similar in stiffness."" – Jolene Wolfe ""Hades is a stiff glass, it is firmer than Effetre, and takes longer to work, but you get better colors and reactions with it than other glass. I love it reduced especially with other reactive colors on top."" – Vonna Maslanka Testers report that Hades does web (but not quite as much as Effetre intense black) and only when super heated. If you are looking for a more crisp effect, then try working in a cooler flame. ""Hades does crawl and I love the effect. It makes great organic beads. The crawling can be controlled by the amount of heating. It will crawl more easily on some colors than others."" – Gail Witt ""Hades crawled only when over heated for a long time. I didn't like it, but I could control it by heating it for a less amount of time even when the heat was very hot! In other words it took me a lot of heat for a long time to get it to crawl. If I used a lot of heat for a shorter [reasonable] time it did not crawl."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood ""I rely on it for all of the wonderful webby effects that I used to buy Intense Black for."" – Kathy Coon ""Hades webs, and the more you heat it the more it will do so."" – Laura Sparling ""I found that Hades did seem to crawl more when in the direct heat, and for me this is not a good thing. I like to work close to the flame, so when used to make dots on white, they didn’t stay dots."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton ""Hades webs when heated well. It webs almost as well as intense black, but not quite as dramatically."" – Lori Bergmann ""Hades will web, but it doesn't 'spider web' like Effetre intense black does. It is a different effect."" – Tim Gottleber Does Hades have any discernible hue? Most testers only saw black, though some reported seeing green, blue, or brown. ""I didn’t notice any base colour – I just saw black, black and more black. Which is nice to see in black glass!"" – Claire Morris ""If it is overheated it deepens to a dark brown."" – Angela Hadorn ""I know the glass isn’t really black, but I can’t see anything but a dense black, even in stringer."" – Gail Witt ""Looks pretty black to me no matter how fine I pull it!"" – Laura Sparling ""Hades has subtle brown to grey/green hues but does not show a discernable hue other than black until it is superheated."" – Bonnie Polinski ""I saw blue, but only in bright sunlight when pulled into thread stringer."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood ""It can have a slight grayish green tint around the edges when melted in as decoration and heated so the edges slightly bleed."" – Lori Bergmann ""Hades is a very dense black and I did not notice a purple or green hue to it."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton Some testers reported that Hades will “ghost” or create a thin parallel line next to itself. ""Hades ghost but only when *really* heated."" – Claire Morris ""Hades creates a slight halo when overheated- it has a tendency to ghost more on colors where it doesn’t crawl."" – Gail Witt ""I noticed ghosting after super-heating the glass."" – Vonna Maslanka ""Hades will ghost, but only when boiled."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood ""It ghosts with some glasses and not others. Over heating will intensify this effect sometimes. I don't like it when I am trying for crisp lines...it's fun if I am playing organicly.

CIM,834,Clear,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Note about Messy Clear We are committed to making an optically clear Clear [no green or blue tints]. During the inspection process, we are careful to remove rods that are not a consistent 4-7 mm diameter, to check that the rods are straight and smooth without bumps, and to remove any rods with seeds, bubbles, stones, or other impurities. We limit handling to prevent scratches, and we package the rods by individually wrapping in tissue paper to prevent scratching during shipment. Like all Messy Colors, our Clear has been formulated and tested to be 104 compatible.  We strive to be as consistent as possible from batch to batch, and to reproduce the Clear on a timely basis so that it is available when you need it. Our testers are sharply divided about whether or not they like Messy Clear. About half reported that they loved Messy Clear and experienced no problems. The other half reported that they could not cope with what they described as boiling. Thanks to our testers, we’ve been able to establish that the wide range of responses is due to the wide range of working atmospheres. Artists who preferred Messy Clear describe their working style as “cool,” or are quite often using a Hot Head. Several testers who could be described as working “hot” noted that they were successful in using Messy Clear without boiling it if they worked it very slowly [much slower than they preferred to work] in the outer reaches of the flame. If you find yourself to be one of the users who can’t seem to prevent Messy Clear from boiling, then I would recommend either working cooler or using a clear that can tolerate working hotter. There is also a relevant point about the ends of our rods. As part of the quality control process, the rods are divided into bundles which are stood vertically and ground over a disc to smooth the ends. Our purpose is to remove any sharp and potentially dangerous edges. Several testers noted that the ground ends of the rods have a tendency to scum. So we discontinued the grinding process for Messy Clear [though we continue to do it on all other color rods]. Thank you to our illustrious testers who have given us this comprehensive feedback. We asked our testers to compare Messy Clear to other 104 clears. [Please note that the variety of responses below were in regards to the same batch of Clear.] “I had just discovered this clear after I got fed up with the Italian clears. So, having had some time to work with CiM's, I prefer it the most because of its clarity and affordability. I have never found it to bubble or boil. It also doesn't scum after working for a long time [I tend to work beads for at least 45 minutes or more].” – Renee Wiggins “The clear is awesome, especially the stringers for encasing – doesn’t boil, few bubbles, great to melt. The Moretti super clear is good as well, but I love the smaller size of Messy Clear.” – Donna Dorman “Messy Clear is my favorite clear, except when annealing at temps below 950 degrees, as it generally cracks at those temps, or when used with silver-laden glass.” – Kathy Coon “I sometimes use Messy Clear, but not when I use silver glass.” – Pat O'Brien “I ONLY use Messy Clear and find that it is almost always compatible with the silver reactive glass that I almost exclusively use at the moment. This most recent batch of test glass, though, was more bubbly and scummy than usual.” – Sue Stewart “I use Messy Clear as we can’t get Lauscha in the UK, and Effetre and Vetrofond don’t cut it for me. I have found recent batches of Messy Clear not to be as good as previous, it has a tendency to boil and seed and needs to be worked very very cool.” – Claire Morris “I only use Messy Clear for encased spacers due to the over soft quality of clear. One must carefully watch how much heat builds up in the glass at all times.  Flame cutting even up very high often will boil the glass despite being conscious of working cool.” – Starleen Colon “I don’t encase much, but when I do I prefer CiM clear, less issues all around.” – Elasia “This is the best clear I've ever used.” – Terri Budrow-Nelson Some testers reported Clear ""boiling,"" ""scumming,"" or ""frothing."" “I find that you need to warm CiM colors more carefully to avoid the cracking, boiling. Even though I have observed bubbling and frothing, I find it’s from working the glass too hot. When I move it out a little further, the issue resolves. CiM seems to need to work just a smidgen ‘cooler’.” – Jennifer Borek “Clear is a dream for me. I have not found it to boil at all.” – Renee Wiggins “Messy Clear is a boiling problem, even when worked cool on any other torch greater than a Hot Head.” – Starleen Colon “I have bought Messy Clear about 2 or 3 times and one batch scummed a lot. I sold it to the students, because we use Hotheads on courses and it did not scum that much with a cooler flame.” – Maija-Leena Autio “My experience with CiM clear is that it likes to be treated on the gentle side, not using lots of heat.” – Leslie Anne Bitgood “Clear works beautifully for me as long as I clean the tip of the rod, 'cook' it for a while to burn off what little bit of micro-bubbles remain, and then keep working it without letting the rod cool off. Once it cools, I have to peel the tip again and start all over again.” – Elizabeth Long “I had great luck with Messy Clear; I use the clear all the time. I work in a cooler flame.” – Donna Dorman ""As for the clear- granted, it's not as crystal clear as Diamond Clear, but it's also not as persnickity or nearly as expensive. I can usually burn off any little bubbles or scum that forms. So CiM clear gets my vote."" – Kandice  Seeber Special thanks to Terri Budrow-Nelson for providing the photo in this section.","""clear""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=24,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511834Clear.jpg,

Love the color density, nice and opaque.” – Chris Haussler “I love Peace; I won’t use any other white. I think it’s the best white out there: doesn’t scorch, melts like butter.” – Donna Dorman “Peace is the only white I will use, others are TOO soupy / shocky.” – Elasia “I don’t use Peace much, I am used to Italian white and I think Italian is a bit more stable.” – Maija-Leena Autio “I have just discovered Peace and am running it through some of my regular work, especially making murrini. The color seems to be very dense, striking denser than it goes on at first. It seems to be just ever so less dense than the Italian pastel white, and also seems to be just a tad cooler in tone. Melts very nice, with no cracking problems at all. I would use the two interchangeably.” – Renee Wiggins “I love Peace as it is stiffer.” – Starleen Colon ""Peace is a stiffer white which makes it better as a base for transparents, for stringer work, and also for encasing. Peace definitely has the reputation of being the best white."" – Caroline Davis ""Since Peace came out, it’s my go to standard white. Peace is a little stiffer to work with and is more dense so this made it particularly better for polka dots on top of other colours - especially transparents. Often with other whites, the colour would stay partly translucent and not at all crisp."" – Trudi Doherty ""Peace I generally love when I need a lot of detail and little movement."" – Hillary Lawson Special thanks to Claire Morris, Lorraine Chandler, Genea Crivello, Carol Oliver, & Julie Fountain for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=26,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511835Peace.jpg,
CIM,872,Tuxedo,,,"CiM Tester Feedback How does Tuxedo compare to other 104 blacks? Testers reported that they prefer Tuxedo because it is denser / blacker. ""Effetre turns purple but continues to have crisp lines, while Tuxedo stays black, but fuzzes out around the edges. I'll take the fuzzy lines over the purple tint.” – Bethany Lemasters ""The third Black on the market is provided by CiM-Messy Color and it is a dark Gray-Black that stays very dense when pulled down to a stringer, making Tuxedo a great contender for best Black on the world market."" Read more at the Frantz Art Glass blog . – Patricia Frantz “I like this very neutral black. The Italian glasses tend to be either on the purple side, or green side. Tuxedo's meltability is FAR better than the Italian black, and it is a bit denser. Effetre black [and Vetro] are horrendous. They boil and pit so bad, but at least the Effetre black smooths out. My only problem with Tuxedo is that I couldn't get it to etch properly at all. Tuxedo didn't completely etch smooth matte, it was more of a satin etch. With that said, if I’m not etching, I would prefer Tuxedo over the Italian blacks any day.” – Renee Wiggins “Vetrofond black is denser than Tuxedo. Effetre black is not. With solid work, Tuxedo functions very well. For stringers and dots, the Italian blacks are much better.” – Angela Hadorn “Tuxedo is a true black, not a purple black, and doesn’t ‘act up’ as the Italian blacks do lately.” – Elasia “I always use Effetre black. I’ve found that Tuxedo is denser than other 104 blacks but it has an odd effect on some stringer. Example – Effetre White on Tuxedo goes all wobbly and slightly feathery.” – Laura Sparling “I find Tuxedo melts more smoothly and is easier to use, so I use this as my go to black.” – Gail Witt “The other blacks are purple, blue, or whatever. Tuxedo is actually black. At the very worst, if it is applied too thinly or allowed to spread out too much, it looks grey.” – Kathy Coon “Tuxedo is a very close second as my favorite black glass to work with – Hades being my favorite. It does not boil or pit, is a good consistency for sculpting, and while it will web if exposed to enough heat, it does not do so easily enough to pose a big problem.” – Carol Oliver “Tuxedo does not 'purple' out on me like Effetre black. I use Tuxedo for surface decoration only. It overruns other colors and I don’t like the look when compared to the Italian glasses, especially Vetrofond black. It is like Tuxedo is a flatter black than the Italian glasses.” – Chris Haussler “Tuxedo is my staple black, because of the price difference from Hades. Tuxedo is a superb value and it’s a fantastic black to work with.” – Donna Dorman “Tuxedo might be blacker than regular Italian blacks. It is something between them and intense blacks, colour and behavior.” – Maija-Leena Autio ""Tuxedo is a great black,  it stays black in thin stringer."" – Caroline Davis What is the difference between Hades & Tuxedo? Hades is our intense black (will maintain its black color even when pulled into stringer) and Tuxedo is our regular black (less dense). “For me, Hades is a 'true' black and Tuxedo is a very deep grey.  Both will get a bit squirrelly with enough heat.” – Chris Haussler “If you melt Hades into white the resulting line will appear black. If you do the same test with Tuxedo, the line appears more purple.” – Gail Witt “Both Hades & Tuxedo are ‘proper’ black instead of really dark purple or blue or whatever; I choose between the two based on how reactive they are with other colors. Tuxedo is rich and stable when I’m not looking for reactions, spreading, or webbing.” – Kathy Coon “To me, Hades is a richer, jet black, while Tuxedo looks the same in a solid bead, but when used as decoration like dots or stringer work, it can look a little less saturated black.” – Lori Bergmann “Tuxedo appears to have a purple base, while Hades looks more blue based. Hades is more dense.” – Teri Yount Technically speaking, Tuxedo is a blue based black, but testers disagreed on their experience of Tuxedo's hue cast. ""Tuxedo is a standard black color, which is a dense transparent like the other black glass versions from Vetrofond and Effetre. But it differs from them in that while Vetrofond has a bluish cast and Effetre has a purple cast when they bleed around the edges, Tuxedo has a grayish-brown cast.""

Testers reported wildly different experiences. ""I discovered that Tuxedo also has a tendency to bleed much more easily than it's big brother Hades, which is my favorite black that is a more dense and blacker formula and has wonderful reactions with silver colors."" Read more at Lori's blog . – Lori Bergmann ""It also does seem to have webbed a little bit."" – Dwyn Tomlinson “I like that Tuxedo is a cheaper alternative to Hades, but noticed that it tends to bleed and/or frazzle fairly quickly. And I don’t like it much for stringer work because it gets a brownish tinge around the edges when melted in. When I used it on a twisty combination, it also looked brown instead of black. So I think I’ll be using it just for solid black shapes or as a base layer and using Hades for any stringer or twisty designs. It does seem like it has some nice organic possibilities, as I got a neat reaction with it over Stone Ground.” – Lori Bergmann “Tuxedo is not very popular. It bleeds a lot faster than the Italian black.” – Angela Hadorn “Tuxedo doesn’t bleed or web."" – Elasia “Tuxedo does web with intense heat, but I think it is much less bleed-y than effetre black.” – Gail Witt “Tuxedo is much more likely to stay where you put it. I think that it bleeds much less than the Italian blacks.” – Kathy Coon ""Tuxedo is more bleedy."" – Kirsty Naray “Tuxedo bleeds more and that´s why I do not like it. Intense blacks can bleed, if they want to, but I like my regular black to be stable. But  I have found out there are lot of people, who like it and think it is not bleeding."" – Maija-Leena Autio “Tuxedo will web/bleed when exposed to intense heat, but not as much as Hades or Effetre Intense black.” – Carol Oliver “In some applications, Tuxedo does web and bleed on me. It is more prone to bleed than the Italian blacks. I have issues using it next to clear, as it tends to creep over the clear and mess up the line that I am trying to lay down. I use it next to other colors intentionally. When it bleeds then, it is not an issue because it adds an interesting effect to the finished product. If I need to have black next to clear and I am expecting it to behave, I use Vetrofond black or Hades.” – Chris Haussler “Tuxedo webs just as much as Hades does equally as much.” – Pat O'Brien Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable (x2), Leslie Anne Bitgood (x2), Bethany Lemasters, Pat O'Brien, Carol Oliver, & Sue Stewart for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=57,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511872Tuxedo.jpg,

Lightens greatly under encasement."" – Starleen Colon ""In my humble opinion, it’s too dark of a brown for my use.  Now that we have Mink, I’m quite content."" – Sue Stewart ""I love this color; it's a superior warm grey to the Italian greys."" – Renee Wiggins ""Adamantium was darker than I expected. It’s the color of dark chocolate with a gray tinge. It’s almost black, so it needs to be balanced against other colors to bring out the brown."" – Jennifer Borek ""I made a test bead with Adamantium and Effetre Dk Gray Pastel and found the Adamantium to be much darker with some brown properties to it. It is a shade that is very interesting. When etched it almost has a green hue to it."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton Testers agreed that, though they might look similar at first glance, Adamantium is significantly different from Lauscha cocoa. ""I don’t think Adamantium compares to Lauscha cocoa, it is way too grey and not brown enough. I don't even feel I could call it a brown. It is a nice colour in itself, but can't be compared to Lauscha cocoa."" – Claire Morris ""I thought cocoa was a bit deeper, but neither thrills me. Still waiting for that perfect deep cocoa Hershey milk chocolate glass. To me, neither of them fit the bill."" – Donna Dorman ""It’s more brown than grey-brown like Lauscha can be . . . Love it."" – Elasia ""Adamantium is darker than Lauscha cocoa, which is a plus."" – Starleen Colon ""Adamantium melts beautifully, sis spread nicely but didn’t on the Lauscha. Colors are close before going in the kiln."" – Pat O'Brien ""Adamantium is not exactly the same shade.  Just a tiny bit off. I think this will be a lovely addition for all of us who don’t buy much Lauscha.  I have not seen Adamantium react in any way [yet]."" – Marcy Lamberson ""Lauscha cocoa is darker and a bit warmer colour, Adamantium is a bit grayer. The difference is not big though. Cocoa is a bit streakier. They react differently with ivory; Adamantium bled more and Cocoa had a more ragged borderline with ivory."" – Maija-Leena Autio ""Adamantium is a slightly lighter, greyer color that I like better than Cocoa, which I find to be a little too dark/dense."" – Lori Bergmann ""They are virtually identical in coloration, but I find Adamantium easier to work with. Lauscha is generally sold in larger diameter rods, and I have a hard time melting them without large chunks flying around. I also prefer Adamantium because it stays stiffer when melted. Adamantium looks sort of like 'dark chocolate' to me."" – Kathy Coon ""I have loved Cocoa and use it frequently, but have always wished it were a darker brown. Well, Adamantium fits the bill. It is a great dark brown that isn’t similar to Cocoa at all. I used it in several beads for decoration, and in some places it almost appears to be black, which was not what I was looking for. Also, when using Cocoa and melting it into a base bead you can pretty much plan on it getting whispy edges and melting into the surrounding glass. This is a beautiful effect, if that is what you want.  Adamantium doesn’t even think about making anything but a nice crisp brown dot. There isn’t anything else available in soft glass that fills this niche.  Many lampworkers have been begging for a dark brown that doesn’t have a red or grey tone to it. Adamantium really looks like the answer for a dark brown."" – Gail Witt ""Adamantium is denser and on the grey side. Lauscha cocoa is warmer and spreads to give a painterly effect which I love."" – Leslie Anne Bitgood Testers report that Adamantium makes a good base for silver/reactive glasses. ""Adamantium serves as a lovely backdrop for silver inclusions as a darker line appears where silver is applied."" – Starleen Colon ""Raku is very pretty on this color."" – Jan Whitesel-Keeton ""I must say that Adamantium looks great as a base for the silver glasses, i.e. Double Helix."" – Chris Haussler Special thanks to Genea Crivello-Knable, Elasia, Leslie Anne Bitgood, Pat O'Brien, Teri Wathan, & Sue Stewart for providing the photos in this section.","""unknown""",,104,rod,https://creationismessy.com/color.aspx?id=60,,https://creationismessy.com/CImages/Colors/MessyColor/Small/511874Adamantium.jpg,

In comparison to Tahitian Pearl, my DSP seems to pit and bubble more than Tahitian Pearl and the metallic finish isn't as even. – Caroline Davis I want to compare the new color of Tahitian Pearl with Dark Silver Plum from Effetre. Of course the effect is similar. Tahitian Pearl is lighter and gives the effect of brushed metal, with notches, with beautiful crystals. – Irina Sergeeva Tahitian Pearl is a new reactive colour from CiM, reminiscent of Gunmetal, and close to Effetre Dark Silver Plum. While I love Tahitian Pearl, for me it is too similar to Dark Silver Plum, but not as cost effective. – Trudi Doherty Tahitian Pearl is WAY easier to use than Effetre Dark Silver Plum. – Lori Peterson Tahitian Pearl is pretty much the same as Effetre pastel Dark Silver Plum 275. In rod form it’s a very dark purple with a sort of brown tinge to it. I found that it behaved almost identically to Dark Silver Plum and I treated it the same way. For the spacers [shown above] I made the bead and let it cool outside the flame for about fifteen seconds. Then I passed the bead back through the mid-part of the flame - not too hot, not too cold - then brought it out to cool for a few seconds and then repeated this until I had the sheen I was happy with. I’ve found that how you reheat both Tahitian Pearl and Dark Silver Plum affects the final finish. A slow pass through the lower part of an oxygen rich, very low propane flame can bring out the more satin silvery effect, and reheating in a *very* slightly reducing one [propane rich] can give you a haematite-like mirror sheen. Too much reduction, however, and you can end up with a muddy purple-brown with a shimmery haze. Read more at Laura's tumblr . – Laura Sparling Tahitian Pearl is a dark greyish purple that gets shiny in the flame while you're working it. As you'll see, I went into my relationship with Tahitian Pearl expecting it to be similar to Adamantium, but ultimately found it quite a bit more like Effetre Dark Silver Plum, only with more interesting variation in surface texture.

Please note that glow in the dark rods will be shorter than the standard lengths you have come to expect from CiM. ""We have been missing glow in the dark glass in COE 104! Glow glass in any COE tends to be super shocky and fragile until it's actually in the liquid form. Once you make something with it, the glow lasts and lasts.

CIM,904,Gellys Sty,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Gelly’s Sty maintains its bright pink hue when used as the body of a piece, but loses its saturation when encased or used as a dot or in stringer work. Please examine the photos on this page carefully as we have chosen them to demonstrate this quality. “I did an encased floral with white dots under Gelly's Sty, which made it a very pale, soft pink. The last bead in the group shot [top photo on right] shows dots of raked rubino on a base of Gelly's Sty and encased in Moretti clear. As you can see, although I burnt the rubino a bit, the pink didn't burn or fade.” – Gelly Davis “The saturation level is controllable- if you want a light pink, use a small stringer, want more color, you need to use more glass. It is something like a transparent glass in that regard.” – Tim Gottleber “It tends to go purple when layered over other colors. I used it over Effetre Black and both times it went a little purple on me. That could be due to it being a tiny bit translucent.” – Dianna Trout Gelly’s Sty occasionally devitrifies, but this can be controlled by working it extremely hot. “I noticed devitrification while initially working with Gelly's Sty, but I am used to ignoring devit. With EDP I let it devit or even burn all it wants. When I am finished with the bead, I heat each area using high oxygen usually it's lips and toenails on Phants to chase out the devit. With your glass I found I did not have to chase it away. I would assume that those whom it concerns need to work your glass hotter, I work like the devil on a mission and it's never hot enough!” – Loco “I didn’t have too much of a problem with devit. I don’t work my beads in a really hot flame, but didn’t have any issues.” – Gail Witt “I experienced devitrification if not worked hot enough.” – Tina Lamasney “I also experienced devit. But when I worked it really low in the flame, the devit went away.” – Stephanie Risberg Gelly’s Sty is unique to the 104 glass color palette. “A great pink! It fills a void in my palette. It is a wonderful color.” – Tim Gottleber “It is a wonderful pink in a world of glass that does not have many good pinks. It presses well, makes great focals, combines well with other colors, and holds it color. On occasion it can even be a little streaky. . . This glass will become one of my staple colors. It gets lots of compliments from people that have seen the finished product. I can’t wait to work more with this glass.” – Jan Whitesel-Keeton “The best pink there is!” – Tina Lamasney Gelly’s Sty likes to be worked hot. ""I have noticed that this glass is more easily thermal shocked, so I add heat more often to account for that . . . work it with a neutral to oxidizing flame and keep it really hot. I put it in the kiln after a thorough heat through."" – Kimberly Affleck ""Gelly’s Sty doesn't hold heat like all my other pinks do. It cools very quickly, so I had to give it extra heat the whole time I was working it. It is much stiffer than Moretti, I kept thinking it's 'chewier.' It doesn't get drippy, which works well for someone like me who does lots of sculpture work.” – Gelly Davis Gelly’s Sty has a translucent or luminous quality. ""This pink is a little too pinky for me. I did use if for some flowers, and it was pretty, although it never really looks totally opaque.” – Gail Witt It really reminds me of chewed up Super Bubble bubble gum. It's not transluscent, but it does have a sheen or shimmer or something to it."" – Gelly Davis Gelly’s Sty etches easily. “It etches just fine. It seems to lose some of its intensity when etched, it becomes a softer pink.” – Tim Gottleber “Etches easily.” – Tina Lamasney ""Gelly’s Sty was sometimes streaky. But when I etched it, it lost the streaky look.” – Stephanie Risberg Testers report that Gelly's Sty shifts in color depending on the type of lighting.

CIM,909,Charlotte,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Charlotte & Paris are very similar transparent pinks  [both are mismelts of the Sakura formula]. Our testers agreed that neither batch could pass as Sakura, but they disagreed on whether or not they were similar enough to give them the same item number/name. It has been our experience that, especially when it comes to very expensive glasses, artists want to know that they are re-purchasing exactly the same color. We chose to market these two batches separately to ensure that customers can choose exactly the hue they prefer. ""Charlotte and Paris – is there any difference? These colours look the same in rod and bead form to me."" – Julie Fountain ""These sample beads look more different than the rods, I don't think Charlotte & Paris would pass for each other even if they were the same formula."" – Jolene Wolfe ""In bead form, Paris is just a tad more saturated than Charlotte. They are very close.

CIM,911,Venus,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Venus was engineered in response to requests for a transparent coral. It is a unique color to the 104 palette. ""Venus is a totally unique color to the 104 coe palette. It is a pale orange with pink undertones that I would consider to be close to a 'coral' in tone. I used other available 'coral' transparent colors in this comparison to test against; such as Bullseye 01834 Coral Orange Tint, and Bullseye 01305 Sunset Coral. As you can see, both colors are quite different, and I feel Venus is an entirely new color to the 104 coe color spectrum."" – Renee Wiggins ""I think I finally figured out Venus. I still get pinker beads but if I flash it out in the flame after shaping I get the orangey hue I want."" – Jennifer Borek Some testers report that Venus is similar to Amber Rose. Other testers noticed a similarity to Sakura. ""To the right is my set of 'Tiger Lily' beads made with old Vetrofond Lavender Blue [791082] compared to Venus and Peachy Keen. I think Venus is a little more orange and lighter, but it's pretty darn close. If it had a tiny bit more 'rose' tone, and slightly darker it would be a dead ringer. I'm excited too!

CIM,922,Heather,,,"CiM Tester Feedback Heather is a cloudy transparent. ""Heather is a lovely colour. I don’t think I’ve got any other pink/purple glass that’s close to it. It’s almost halfway between CiM Crocus and CiM Rose Quartz."" – Heather Johnson Some testers found it difficult to maintain Heather's pinkness. ""I seem to remember someone else had Heather go grey and the colour came back in the kiln as well, the same as I did. I didn't think it was a problem, just a working property of the glass, a bit like yellows go red and reds go black until they cool again."" – Heather Johnson ""I got grey when heating at first, but then I treated this colour like I do striking colours, so I gave it plenty of reheats, slightly cool, reheat, etc. This removed the grey. The end result once annealed was the same colour as the rod [gorgeous!]"" – Juliette Mullett ""I was able to achieve the colour in the rod form but took a different approach to normal. Instead of melting a pea sized gather and applying on the mandrel I applied the glass to the mandrel in small increments, like layering. By using this technique I was able to build the colour up to the hue percentage I wanted. More time consuming than usual but achieved some lovely results and the beads I made using the cloudy transparent sold straight away."" – Juliette Mullett Testers were divided on whether or not they liked the cloudy transparents. ""I like the cloudy transparents. Lots!"" – Carol Ann Savage ""I didn't get on with the cloudy transparents. If you can add more pigment and they are not shocky, I think they would be good."" – Suzy Hannabuss ""I found the cloudy transparent glass to be much stiffer than other glass so it was a bit hard to sculpt with."" – Lori Peterson ""I had rods of cloudy transparent colors that were light as well as rods that were very dark. I made some beads with the dark rod of Watermelon and very little light came through the glass and the color was unappealing to me. However, the dark rod of Chocolate is a very nice brown. With such a huge difference between rods, I think it’s kind of a confusing sale if dark and light rods are presented as the same color."" – Gloria Sevey Many testers reported that our cloudy transparents were prone to shockiness or breakage. **Please pre-warm / pre-anneal rods accordingly.** ""In general, I have found the Cloudy Transparent colours to be a bit shocky. For the most part, this was quite manageable and well worth the effort, at least for the colours I've tried so far."" Read more at Melanie's blog . – Melanie Graham ""I experienced neither shockiness nor boiling with the cloudy transparents. I did use a cool flame though. I’ve changed my method of introducing glass rods to the flame which reduces shocking considerably [almost non-existent unless there are holes in the rod]. I rotate the tip of my rod way above the flame for a short time and then slowly rotate it downward into the flame. It’s usually starting to melt by that time. That said, not everyone uses this cautious of a method and might have rods being shocky because of being put into the flame when they’re still cold."" – Gloria Sevey ""In the new cloudy colors it does seem the thicker the rod the more saturated the color seems to be. I had zero issue with Heather, Morgan and Watermelon. However my beloved Pink Lemonade and Vintage Rose were super shocky even with kiln warming."" – Michelle  Veizaga ""Heather is a little shocky so a little pre-warming and careful introduction to the flame is all that’s needed. I’ve not had a lot of luck as Heather layered over Effetre White cracked [probably thermal] and when I tried over CiM Peace I got all sorts of crazy cracks. I found Chocolate a bit shocky, certainly more so than Watermelon which surprised me since they are both cloudy transparents and made in the same way. However pre-warming the rod seemed to help and the shocky-ness certainly wouldn’t put me off."" – Heather Johnson ""I agree with the mostly-too-shocky."" – Dwyn Tomlinson ""I made a clear base and encased with the cloudy transparents, but sadly the beads cracked."" – Trudi Doherty ""I experienced micro cracks when combining several of the cloudy transparents with 96 COE frit."" – Darlene Collette ""I didn’t have any problems with the cloudy transparents! They weren’t shocky or boiled, but I have to admit, that I work in a cold flame and very carefully to prevent any bad incident."" – Claudia Eidenbenz ""I found them intolerably shocky."" – Laurie Nessel ""I preheated all the testing rods in a Devardi rod warmer as it was particularly cold in the UK at that time and this is something I always do that time of year. By doing this I didn't experience any shockiness. I also used a very thin encasement of Effetre Superclear 006 before applying cloudy transparents as an encasement - no issues."" – Juliette Mullett ""I found the cloudy transparents shocky, that they boiled easily in the flame which created micro bubbles on the surface of beads, and that under clear encasement some of them cracked."" – Jolene Wolfe Some testers reported that our cloudy transparents were prone to boiling. ""I did find some cloudy transparents could boil if you worked them too hot. I like to work them cooler and with not too much oxygen in the flame."" – Trudi Doherty ""I had no issues with any of the cloudy transparents apart from a little bubbling in 1 or 2 of them."" – Juliette Mullett ""Another thing common to all of these colours [so far] is that they can be easy to boil, so you really have to watch your heat. This is true not only with fine stringer, but also when applying the glass from the rod to your bead. Work higher up in the flame and a bit cooler to avoid this problem."" Read more at Melanie's blog . – Melanie Graham Testers were divided on whether or not they liked the wispy or streaky quality of the cloudy transparents. ""All but two of the new color strands sold and the two that didn’t sell didn’t get much attention [Chocolate and Heather, both cloudy transparents]. I think that maybe those cloudy transparents just didn’t have enough zing to capture the mood hopes of this moment in time."" – Gloria Sevey ""There are lots of straight transparents. I'd vote for more cloudy transparents. If the glass is wispy then you can use those qualities to your advantage when making beads."" – Carol Ann Savage ""I loved the wispy/streaky quality, for me that was a big part of the attraction."" – Trudi Doherty ""I think the wispy/streaky quality is great for certain designs, but it's not something I prefer."" – Laurie Nessel ""I quite like the wispy quality, but I do like the more saturated streaks."" – Heather Johnson ""Some of my studio mates were unhappy with the color saturation in the cloudy transparents, particularly when making blown beads."" – Janet Evans ""I thought the wispiness was an upside.

In contrast, looking at the little bead of solid Lingonberry, it does not look butterscotch at all- just a deep pomegranate juice.” – Jenefer Ham ""I used just a touch of Lingonberry on a white based vessel and saw that it reduced very fast.

This color works great in the neutral flame region and can handle all flame atmospheres for short amounts of time. Do not use a highly reducing flame or a very sharp hot flame without quick movement of the color; this will avoid any possibility of minor boil spots. The vibrancy of Acid Yellow Crayon is a wonderful backing to many Glass Alchemy transparent colors, also a very complimentary color to the other opaques, and desirable for murine applications as well.

Working Tip: Work this color like you would Triple Passion or a similar striking color. Since this color also has chrome it in work it in a neutral flame and garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “Andromeda is a transparent green sparkle that strikes when heated to a transparent amber that will continue to strike to a deep purple, if the layer of color is thick enough. In addition to the base color there is sparkle and silver that will fume the surface of the color as it gets worked. You can treat Andromeda similar to GA Triple Passion and use an intense, sharp flame to burn off the silver fume on the surface if you wish to show the brilliance of the sparkle in the finish of your piece. You can get a range of finishes with this color without encasement, depending on how long the color is worked and in what flame atmosphere. I have found that when encased in clear, Andromeda handles very well and the clear can often intensify the sparkle. If worked before encasement you can trap silver fuming off the color and have a milky blue ghostly veil over your sparkle green or purple. The sparkle flakes in Andromeda seem to reflect a rainbow of color, ending in gold. The color can be manipulated by twisting, compressing, layering and thinning the amount of color used and how it is worked into your piece, resulting in a number of finishing looks. When kiln striking the base color to shift into deeper colors try 1100 degrees Fahrenheit for short intervals of time until you see the desired results.

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""Aquatic Carnival is a very deep teal transparent, packed with silver and copper. A neutral flame keeps the piece looking like the cane before being fired. An over oxidizing sharp hot flame setting may scum or boil when repeatedly immersed into the fire. To best avoid unwanted effects, either work your piece in the middle of the length of your torch flame or pre-encase with clear. When Aquatic Carnival is on the surface you can repeatedly reduce in the torch flame to bring out an array of color and effects.

This brownish olive green transparent is wonderful for solid color sculpting and works very nicely for blown work as well. For larger blown work, I recommend sandwiching between a clear tube and another layer of clear or transparent color, reason being that Beryl is made up of a significant amount of copper. When a heavy copper color is not encased and on the surface for blown work that will be melted, blown, and manipulated it will tend to react with different amounts of propane and oxygen in your flame mix. So where Beryl may feel similar to working clear, it will prefer working about halfway to three quarters of the flame length away from the tip of your torch in an even mix of gas. Heavy reduction or propane in the flame mix, very close to the tip of your torch, will react with the copper in the color causing different surface effects.

It can be worked into and mixed with other colors to create your own new sparkle colors. Disco Sparkle can be worked without encasement for an extremely dense sparkle finish that is smooth to the touch but looks as though there is a textured surface. For a wide variety of uses, I melt and condense a rod of 7mm Disco Sparkle into smaller thicker sections and use a thin encasement of clear 3mm rod and redraw out to desired cane size, usually about 4mm. This leaves you with an easily workable and still very dense sparkle finish. Take the ratio of five inches of 7mm clear rod and a half inch of Disco Sparkle and mix thoroughly for the look of a light amount of sparkle needed to accent or encase another color.

It work smooth and melts into itself without a trace of layering. It is a bit stiffer than clear when blowing it out or drawing it down. Eclipse stringers are black down to 1mm when they appear to be a dense smoky transparent black. A 2mm or 3mm thick layer of Eclipse over any tubing is enough to create the appearance of a solid black colored tube; keeping the clear underneath helps core heat remain while you work and saves on color versus coiled solid color. Reheating as many times as you want and numerous or long hours of kiln cycles don't seem to be an issue with Eclipse. I used it inside and on the back of large marbles with great results. Basically it’s my new go to black. I use GA Raven all the time and now Eclipse will fill tons of those jobs where really long flame exposure time or atmosphere was previously an issue with how my black looked in the finish of the piece.

This color holds up well in encasement and can be mixed with other colors to create custom super sparkle colors! Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “GA Jackpot has large flakes of sparkle giving this transparent deep money green an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. Whether you stripe, coil, mash, layer, twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changing the “look” or finish. You can achieve a larger flake or sparkle when the rod is applied and worked in flat without much manipulation. This color is great for every application including solid work, with or without encasement. Hollow forms will yield a beautiful array of effects depending on the thickness in color layer. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Jackpot will be transparent yet still lend a lot of sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Jackpot is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result would be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant base color. At any time, a thin layer of clear over Jackpot will often ""brighten"" it up a bit and the encasement always helps amplify the sparkle while leaving your surface clean and crisp. Jackpot can be encased in thick clear for marbles and sculptures.

The striking properties range from rubies to purples and blues, yellows and greens. While working the piece you will see continuous color shifts and you should consider how thick your color application is and at what point you would like the color to stop changing. For example, increased kiln time and temp will strike out the rubies and purples leaving you with a different looking piece that went in the kiln. The mixing of results that you will find as you work this color is just gorgeous. I find myself wanting to keep the array of pinks, oranges, rubies and yellows that earned the persimmon reference, but the light greens and blues that show up during the sculpting process compliment the other colors so well, a delicate balance of intense spot heating and reheating is needed to capture the whole range in one piece. I think that a quick annealing at 1030F is called for when you like the look of the piece going into the kiln.

Working the color without encasement in the outer flame is ideal but quick passes in a sharp hot flame closer to your torch tip also works. Red Crayon works smooth and melts down without any potential sublimination if you have a bit of patience and keep from concentrating a sharp hot flame on one spot. It requires time to warm up and allow the heat to penetrate past the surface of the color. In other words think of your flame as a small brush and move lightly around the area you intend to get molten in a spot heat situation.

Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “With large flakes of sparkle, this transparent deep brilliant blue has an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. If you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble. When the rod is applied and worked without much manipulation, it will show much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the “look” or finish. This color is great for every application including solid, with or without encasement, and hollow forms with varying thickness in color. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Sapphire will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Sapphire is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result will be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant blue base color.” – Mike Shelbo","""blue""",,33,rod,https://glassalchemy.com/products/sapphire-5595,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0965/6730/products/A-5595Sapphire-New.jpg?v=1629231830,

It works very smoothly and melts without sublimation or any definition of the termination when separated from itself. While I have had success with encasement under a thick layer of clear, I still suggest testing and experimentation when using opaque greens to check if the application works in different circumstances. GA Shamrock pairs well with all other GA Crayon colors, I recommend GA Sno White and GA Rasta Gold. Try encasement of GA Shamrock with other opaques and transparent colors for a variety of different effects when drawn out thin or blown out to thinly veil the Shamrock.

If desired, Sno White can be sandwiched between clear and blown out very thin and achieve a slightly translucent or milky finish. Without encasement in clear or another color you must work Sno White like other crayon colors and try to do most heating about an inch or so further out than where you work your clear glass. It can handle quick heats with an intense, hot and sharp flame, but do not overheat tiny areas and you will avoid bubbling.Sno White melts into itself smoothly and easily without trace of where color overlaps itself. For thick, solid sculpture work, I prefer to encase clear rod with Sno White so the core of the sculpture is more flexible and can hold core heat longer. Try encasing Sno White in every Glass Alchemy translucent color and find a whole new palette of colors that includes more pastels and can create a bold and vibrant look for your basic what you see is what you get colors."" - Mike Shelbo","""white""",,33,rod,https://glassalchemy.com/products/sno-white-9995,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0965/6730/products/9995_b811fe6a-d880-4798-92a4-97b0b3d93f8d.jpg?v=1608663110,
GA,A-4585,Starry Night,,,"Starry Night, 4585 is a variation of the much loved Paparazzi, 4595. We added a touch of silver so you can yield a nice mild strike, while still seeing the depth of sparkle. Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “Starry Night is similar in sparkle flake, size and structure to Paparazzi and Sapphire, but has the added addition of just the right amount of silver to bring a fume like veil over the surface of your sparkle finish. When working Starry Night you must keep the surface in mind as the silver will push out in a ghost blue transparent cloudiness. You can remove the cloudiness with an intense spot heat, or let it build up to a slightly cream colored fume. Either way, there are loads of sparkles and possibilities for swirling silver into your pieces. I found I liked putting a thick layer of Starry Night over a clear tube, melting it smooth, encasing it with 6mm clear rod and then melting that to either stretch down, or blow out thin.

GA,NG-490,Tonic,,,"Tonic has a vintage glass look and is a younger sibling of Rain Drop. For best results, this crisp, high index color should be used in a neutral flame. Working Tip: Work neutral to oxidizing for best results. A reducing flame will cause red streaking. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""Tonic is a transparent blue, the color of an aquamarine gem. The color becomes more vibrant and its higher refractive index shows when used with itself in applications that allow the Tonic layer to be as thick as possible. When used as tubing, applied on clear or as coiled color, if the Tonic will be exposed to a lot of different working flames and long times in and out of the kiln, I advise a thin clear coat to protect the surface from overworking. Too much propane in your flame can result in a copper reduction leaving you with red streaks or patches on the surface of the un-encased Tonic. Too much over oxidizing can leave you with a surface haze or scuzz that must be swiped to remove. I often recommend a thin layer of clear frit over Tonic or evenly coated clear rod over your entire prep. I have used Tonic without encasement many times on solid sculpture and had good results, but I have seen a warming or flashing flame haze up a section. Working Tonic in as close to a neutral flame and away from the face of your torch is wise and will get you the best results with the color. If you have worked Raindrop in the past, this color is very similar in working properties. My favorite application is to gather up rods into 18mm or thicker sections and sculpt them into figurines. This next generation transparent is definitely a must have to fill out the rainbow palette. It can be layered over other colors like white for a nice pastel, but will be a faint tint unless applied as a 5-7mm thick layer. The first impression Tonic made on me was the thought that it was the color of window glass or old soda bottles, both aqua blue colors that I have always been fond of.” – Mike Shelbo","""unknown""",,33,rod,https://glassalchemy.com/products/tonic-490,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0965/6730/products/Tonic_31601bb0-2dfc-45e8-b247-377928df2c8e.jpg?v=1607558339,

It can be drawn down to a very thin stringer and still hold its true color. It works very smooth for being such a dark green, which are often prone to stiffness.

While I have had success with encasement under a thick layer of clear, I still suggest testing and experimentation when using opaque greens to check if the application works in different circumstances.

Working Tip: Get this color white hot to erase the striking history. A variety of effects are achievable depending on how long you flame/kiln strike. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""You know it, you love it, and you can use it so many ways! Triple Passion is a striking color full of silver goodness. This means that as your translucent base glass shifts from a golden yellow to amber and into purples and violets you will also see a reaction from the silver adding in blue and green and purple hues. To best understand how this will work as you make your piece, heat your color rod to a molten state, let it cool, then with a normal working flame heat for a second at a time and pause in between to watch results.

Garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Use of reduction at the end of the project can produce subtle red tones. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ""This color is a natural earth-toned opaque greenish blue. Turquoise is great for solid sculpture and blown work. The density of the color will stay true to the color of the rod before manipulation but when blown, it can become a milky translucent and opalescent version of itself. This is best achieved by sandwiching between clear and blowing thin. Turquoise works creamy but the slightest bit stiffer than other opaques. Overworking the surface of the color when not encased in clear can lead to undesired surface texture and finish. However, when desired you can use a reduction flame with heavy propane on unencased Turquoise before you put your piece in the annealer to bring out the copper, which will result in very natural toned red tints and streaks interacting with your base color."" - Mike Shelbo","""blue"", ""green""",,33,rod,https://glassalchemy.com/products/turquoise-445,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0965/6730/products/445_2b197762-e670-43ae-a933-0577ece77cb6.jpg?v=1607207606,

This blue is a deep, opaque color that is darker than Peacock, but still a very distinct blue that has a special place in the color palette. It works great for sculpting solid work and for blown work. Twilight lends well to many styles of application.
