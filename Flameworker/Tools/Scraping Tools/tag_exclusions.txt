# Products in this list will have specific tags excluded even if the keywords appear.
# Use this for false positives (e.g., "striking" meaning "beautiful" instead of the technical term).

# Format: URL<TAB>excluded_tag1,excluded_tag2,excluded_tag3
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are ignored
