      "manufacturer_description": "Blue Honey is as rich and deep as Dave's Blues before you heat it up. When you strike it retains its' translucence but gets waves of purples and gains a greenish blue appearance. It's a very workable color but refrain from a heavily reducing environment. Blue Honey is the rarest of all honeys because it comes from the Blue Bumble Bee. The Blue Bumble Bee first came about when a guy named Dave used to play the blues for fields of wild flowers. All of those wild flowers started taking in the blues and created blue pollen which the local bumble bees used to make their hives with. After many seasons of Dave playing the blues for the buzzing and bumbling locals he noticed that these bees had turned blue. They were a more laid back kind of bee. Dave checked out their hive one day after following one of these blue dudes back to their den where he found the Blue Honey. When you want the best, where do you reach? To the top shelf! We feel this is our best glass. What more can we say? Top shelf is recommended for the professional artist looking for top quality product.Comparable to other’s odds, middle shelf glass is misshapen or out of round, but the glass is still in near perfect composition and free from large stones or inclusions. We recommend this glass for artists on a budget who still want good quality color but are willing to work with small variances in shape and size.Comparable to other’s seconds, bottom shelf glass includes glass that is still very usable, but may have excess air or small stones in it. We recommend this glass for beginning glass workers to use as practice, or for the production worker looking to drop their costs.Sold by the pound. Go ahead and select your quality level below.",

      "manufacturer_description": "Electric Coconut brings one of the best colors out of the 90’s and puts it straight into your hands. Under natural light conditions Electric Coconut appears as an off white color and when you blast it with a UV light it turns a bright green which is reminiscent of the off yellow-white color that was found frequently in 90’s toys and clothing.
