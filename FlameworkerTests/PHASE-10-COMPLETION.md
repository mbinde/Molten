# Phase 10 Completion: Extension and Model Files Review

## Files Found in Test Directory That Are Actually Source Code

The following files were found in the test directory but are actually **main application source code files** that should be moved to the appropriate source code directory:

### âœ… **Source Code Files to Relocate:**

1. **`LocationService.swift`** (53 lines)
   - **Type:** Service class
   - **Purpose:** Manages inventory item locations and auto-complete suggestions
   - **Should be moved to:** `Flameworker/Services/` directory

2. **`CoreDataEntity+Extensions.swift`** (39 lines)
   - **Type:** Core Data entity extensions
   - **Purpose:** Provides display titles for PurchaseRecord and CatalogItem entities
   - **Should be moved to:** `Flameworker/Extensions/` or `Flameworker/Models/` directory

3. **`CoreDataMigrationService.swift`** (398 lines)
   - **Type:** Migration service
   - **Purpose:** Handles Core Data schema migrations, backup, and rollback operations
   - **Should be moved to:** `Flameworker/Services/` or `Flameworker/Data/` directory

### ðŸ“‹ **Recommended Actions:**

These files should be **moved** (not deleted) from the test directory to the appropriate main source code directories. They are legitimate application code that was misplaced during development.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Files Successfully Reviewed:**

All other files listed in Phase 10 were not found in the test directory, indicating they were either:
- Already properly located in the main source code
- Already cleaned up in previous phases
- Never existed as test files

## Phase 10 Status: âœ… COMPLETED

**Result:** Identified 3 legitimate source code files that need to be relocated from the test directory to the main application source code directory. No test consolidation was needed since these are not test files.
