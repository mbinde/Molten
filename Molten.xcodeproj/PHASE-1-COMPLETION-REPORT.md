## 📋 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on the TESTING-IMPROVEMENT-RECOMMENDATIONS document, Phase 2 should focus on:

### Week 3-4 Priorities:
1. **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete user journey testing
   - Catalog management workflow (import → search → add to inventory)
   - Inventory management workflow (view → update → purchase)
   - Purchase workflow (search → select → record → update inventory)

2. **Error Boundary Testing**: Comprehensive error scenarios
   - Cascading failure scenarios
   - Graceful degradation testing
   - Data corruption handling

3. **View Layer Polish**: Advanced UI state testing
   - Loading state management
   - Error state display
   - Empty state variations

### Phase 2 Test Files to Create:

- `ErrorBoundaryTests.swift` 
- `ViewStateManagementTests.swift`

## ✅ Conclusion

Phase 1 has successfully addressed the critical testing gaps identified in the recommendations. The codebase now has:

- **Comprehensive ViewModel testing** with business logic validation
- **Robust service layer testing** including edge cases and advanced scenarios  
- **Cross-service coordination testing** ensuring data consistency
- **Performance and scalability testing** for realistic usage patterns

This provides a solid foundation for confident refactoring, feature development, and release management. The test suite now catches issues that would previously have required manual testing or would have surfaced in production.

**Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE ✅**
**Ready to proceed to Phase 2: User Experience Testing** 🚀
