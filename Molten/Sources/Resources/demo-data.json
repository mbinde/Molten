What are Odd Lots (Light, Dark, Odd) An Odd Lot is a batch of a regular stock color that did not pass its color matching test. If it was lighter than the standard, it\u2019s labeled light. Darker, labeled Dark. For any other non color matching reason, it\u2019s labeled Odd. Therfore, one batch of Light to another will not necessarily be the same. Some could be slightly lighter than the standard and others much lighter. A picture of the current batch of Light is in the gallery for your reference. MY ALL TIME GO TO FOR SCROLLWORK. only glass I don\u2019t have to reduce to bring up the luster (for times I don\u2019t want a lot of fuming), but if reduced its deep and lots of pink highlights.

Here\u2019s a short video of the process. In our experience, a brush reduction flame produces the best results. Tips from Jed: It does require particular flame settings, and bead heat and reduction duration are more critical. My specific timings work for my specific set up. It is going to vary from person to person. Here is my process. 1) Shape bead 2) Allow bead to cool for 20 seconds. 3) Adjust flame so candles are stretched 2mm from neutral. 4) Pass bead through flame, candles should touch bead and deflect yellow flame around the edges. 1.5 seconds duration for each pass. 5) Allow bead to cool 5 seconds between passes. 6) Repeat pass-through and cooling cycle 5-15 times. 7) Anneal.",

Compared to the 740/743.opl it is slower striking, and more translucent after annealing. 752.opl can be worked hot and fast in the torch flame. Working notes: -To retain the transparent opal effect, limit kiln temperature and annealing time. I use 920F for up to two hours for misty-opal beads. Clear encasement seems to accelerate opacification in the annealer. Kilns vary in the amount of heat at the beads\u2019 location vs the displayed temperature. Your kiln is probably different than mine. Test beads are recommended. -A Reset/Cooling/Striking cycle can be used in the flame to alter the appearance of the opal effect. An encased bead that has been reset, air-cooled for 45 seconds, then very gently struck for 45 seconds seems to maintain the opalescent effect better than a bead annealed directing after resetting. The 752.opl\u2019s reset and striking temperatures are lower than that of silver glasses. When reset, the glass is crystal clear, and when fully struck the glass is a milky opaque white. Variable opacity can be produced by controlling the thermal history of the workpiece.

A major improvement over Luna 3 and Khaos, it resists over striking to khaki. Skiron works best when reset, cooled, and struck. Cooling and striking times will vary based on bead size, flame temperature, and other factors but general guidelines are; Surface applications: reset, cool for 30 seconds, strike for 30-45 seconds. Encased applications: encase, reset, cool for 45 seconds, strike for 45-60 seconds. The cooling cycle is an important factor in repeatable end results. Shorter than recommended cooling times typically yield white and purple, while longer cooling times can yield dark Amber with blue tints. Somewhere in between lies the ideal cooling/striking timing for your application and set up. Learn More View Jed\u2019s tutorial on How to Make a Skiron and Aether Bead.",

We are pushing this color's boundaries, making it as dense as possible, while keeping it an acidic lemony yellow. If you want a more traditional yellow, try Yellow Crayon. Working Tip: Pre-heat in outer flame. Avoid rapid heating Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This very bright opaque yellow will stay true when drawn down to smaller cane sizes and will not transmit light unless the application of color is thinner than 2mm. This color works great in the neutral flame region and can handle all flame atmospheres for short amounts of time. Do not use a highly reducing flame or a very sharp hot flame without quick movement of the color; this will avoid any possibility of minor boil spots. The vibrancy of Acid Yellow Crayon is a wonderful backing to many Glass Alchemy transparent colors, also a very complimentary color to the other opaques, and desirable for murine applications as well. Encasement in clear is not necessary but can be used to increase yield on size of solid or blown work and allow for more intense working conditions.\" - Mike Shelbo",

These features and many more have allowed Agua Azul, 446 to become one of the finest opaques in the borosilicate world. Working Tip: Work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975\u00b0 F, Anneal at 1050\u00b0 F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This opaque aqua blue works great and has never given me any problems. I know that it is one of the most popular Glass Alchemy colors and the reason is because no matter which way you work it, the results are fantastic. I use it for murrine, solid sculpture, blown work on clear tubing or coil potted and with or without encasement in clear. Agua Azul holds its color as it is drawn out into stringers and is applied smoothly and works creamy. When blown extremely thin you can see slight translucent qualities and minuscule air bubbles, but this only shows when not encased and blown thinner than 1mm. Complimenting and contrasting a wide array of Glass Alchemy colors, Agua Azul is a mandatory part of my palette and has been since I first used it long ago.\" - Mike Shelbo",

This has yielded metallic colors ranging from a shiny copper penny to a beautiful rainbow iridescence. You can also repeatedly kiln your finished piece at 1040F to 1100F to achieve a metallic effect, leaving a slight luster finish of blues and purples and sometimes cream and green on top of your underlying dense browns and reds.

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cAndromeda is a transparent green sparkle that strikes when heated to a transparent amber that will continue to strike to a deep purple, if the layer of color is thick enough. In addition to the base color there is sparkle and silver that will fume the surface of the color as it gets worked. You can treat Andromeda similar to GA Triple Passion and use an intense, sharp flame to burn off the silver fume on the surface if you wish to show the brilliance of the sparkle in the finish of your piece. You can get a range of finishes with this color without encasement, depending on how long the color is worked and in what flame atmosphere. I have found that when encased in clear, Andromeda handles very well and the clear can often intensify the sparkle. If worked before encasement you can trap silver fuming off the color and have a milky blue ghostly veil over your sparkle green or purple. The sparkle flakes in Andromeda seem to reflect a rainbow of color, ending in gold. The color can be manipulated by twisting, compressing, layering and thinning the amount of color used and how it is worked into your piece, resulting in a number of finishing looks. When kiln striking the base color to shift into deeper colors try 1100 degrees Fahrenheit for short intervals of time until you see the desired results. Andromeda pairs well with GA Eclipse and GA Grape.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

An over oxidizing sharp hot flame setting may scum or boil when repeatedly immersed into the fire. To best avoid unwanted effects, either work your piece in the middle of the length of your torch flame or pre-encase with clear. When Aquatic Carnival is on the surface you can repeatedly reduce in the torch flame to bring out an array of color and effects. Try rotating the area you want reduced until a soft orange glow (not molten) appears, then remove from flame and wait a moment to see the result. Reduction at the end of the creation process yields completely different results than a piece worked in a reduction flame the whole time it was made. Bursts and gradients of greens and blues on the top of the deep teal creates beautiful tones, very reminiscent of water and the play of light on the ocean.\" - Mike Shelbo",

A color that is seen (but not often noticed) in nature and called retro by those that recall the oil lamps and cruets of the 60's, Beryl, 833 makes a great bead color, is useful as a tint or sculptural color. Working Tip: Work in neutral flame to avoid reduction (red streaks). Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This is one of my favorite translucent WYSIWYG colors. This brownish olive green transparent is wonderful for solid color sculpting and works very nicely for blown work as well. For larger blown work, I recommend sandwiching between a clear tube and another layer of clear or transparent color, reason being that Beryl is made up of a significant amount of copper. When a heavy copper color is not encased and on the surface for blown work that will be melted, blown, and manipulated it will tend to react with different amounts of propane and oxygen in your flame mix. So where Beryl may feel similar to working clear, it will prefer working about halfway to three quarters of the flame length away from the tip of your torch in an even mix of gas. Heavy reduction or propane in the flame mix, very close to the tip of your torch, will react with the copper in the color causing different surface effects. A very natural tone for your color palette, Beryl will compliment many other Glass Alchemy colors and when standing alone should be given the opportunity for light to transmit through the color for best presentation.\" - Mike Shelbo",

At the time the market needed a black that did not boil and we introduced 3 new blacks to choose from. Black Violet is a deep translucent that is extremely workable, great for beads and other sculptural projects. It is popular because it flows together without transition lines, is very shiny and the surface does not easily reduce. Working Tip: Work this color hot using a neutral flame. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Following closely behind Glass Alchemy Black Blue in saturation, this dense translucent black is good for several applications with different results. When kept 3mm or thicker, Black Violet will transmit a true manganese purple and reflect back a dense black. This color works nicely as it melts easily and will smooth into itself without trace of where application overlaps. When drawn into thin stringers you can see the violet come out of the color, and when applied thin or blown thin, this color is a beautiful translucent shade of violet that could be described as a smoky purple.\" - Mike Shelbo",

If thinned out to a stringer or 4mm or less, the color becomes a lighter tint. With a higher refractive index, I use this color mostly as solid bits and thicker tubing sections. I found it to be quite optically clear and mostly air-free. If you are a fan of Brilliant Blue, then you will love this more transparent shade of bright cobalt. It can be exposed to many flame atmospheres and working conditions without any concern. I would not recommend an overly heavy propane flame for a long working time, but Blue Dream seems to be quite resilient to reduction issues other cobalt\u2019s may have. Blue Dream compliments Sno White and pairs well with Haterade, Raindrop, and GA\u2019s other transparents.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Boil spots can be avoided by folding/pushing the separation point into the bit while molten or place a tiny dab of clear on top, but do not overheat directly while melting in.

The shift in color as heating penetrates the layers of thickness in your work will show you how quickly you can warm, or flash, your work and have the core warm-up without losing any sharp detail you may have on the surface.\" - Mike Shelbo",

This color is still light enough to see through when the thickness of color is 8mm or less. Over reduction with heavy propane flame will leave minor grey streaks but working with a neutral flame will prevent this from happening.

While many people use the color full strength, others mix it down as much as 10 parts of clear (or color) to 1 part of Disco Sparkle, 9958. Even if using the rod full strength it is best to remix the color prior to using for a smooth, highly reflective surface. Working Tip: Disco likes to be worked cool as to avoid yellowing... Treat it like a Crayon color. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This is the sparkle color of all sparkle colors. Glass Alchemy created this color for several reasons. It can be worked into and mixed with other colors to create your own new sparkle colors. Disco Sparkle can be worked without encasement for an extremely dense sparkle finish that is smooth to the touch but looks as though there is a textured surface. For a wide variety of uses, I melt and condense a rod of 7mm Disco Sparkle into smaller thicker sections and use a thin encasement of clear 3mm rod and redraw out to desired cane size, usually about 4mm. This leaves you with an easily workable and still very dense sparkle finish. Take the ratio of five inches of 7mm clear rod and a half inch of Disco Sparkle and mix thoroughly for the look of a light amount of sparkle needed to accent or encase another color. If you plan to blow Disco Sparkle out into thin bubbles make sure to encase in clear. Disco Sparkle can also handle encasement under thick clear.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Striking a bit slower than its Triple counterpart, you can see more yellows, ambers, oranges and pinks. The amount of silver in the color allows you to have a surface buildup of wispy and cloudy bursts of light blues and cream colors that can be controlled by the amount of propane in your torch flame setting. When worked very hot, you are left with an intense pink or magenta color. Your Double Passion will transmit light of different colors depending on how much the base color strikes and how much silver you let rest on the surface.

It is a self striking deep ruby that does not over strike or liver. Dragon's Blood can be used in all applications such as surface work, inside out, solid or hollow sculpture and can be diluted to different consistencies for a brighter ruby finish. An example of this is that the goblin head bead is coiled Dragon's Blood and while still transparent enough to let light transmit through, it strikes to the perfect deep ruby that is dark enough to seem opaque. When experimenting with Dragon's Blood I covered a point of one inch heavy wall clear tube with it and blew it out thin to achieve a lighter, brighter, perfect ruby. When sandwiched between clear layers and blown out you can see the color goes a long way and with the self striking quality of the glass, you are able to see what you can expect from different ratios of color to clear.\" - Mike Shelbo",

      "manufacturer_description": "Dragon's Eye, 4838 is a fantastic surface color that has a wide range of possibilities. This color is a green tone, with enough color changing silver to allow organic shifts without overpowering the base green. If you like Amazon Night, then you will want to try out this tamed down option. Working Tip: Flame or kiln strike at 1075\u00b0F. Work neutral; reduce at end for metallic effects. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This color can be worked either unencased or encased. When working this color unencased I advise using a flame that has a bit more oxygen in the mix than your normal settings. This will allow you to use reduction properly at the end of the piece by increasing the amount of propane in your torch flame. Through reduction your transparent green base glass will push out colors ranging from creamy blues and greens to yellows, oranges, and purples to a metallic rainbow iridescence. Encasement of rod will yield softer tones over green depending on flame settings during the encasement process.\" - Mike Shelbo",

      "manufacturer_description": "Eclipse is our most popular, easy to use black. When pulled down thin, Eclipse maintains a smoky black color, versus purple, like Black Violet. Described by many as \u201cbullet proof\u201d, Eclipse does not contain any chrome, so graying and checking are not a major concern. If you need a more saturated black, check out Raven, 9749. Working Tip: This color can handle different flame atmospheres but as always, we recommend working in a neutral flame. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cEclipse is a dense, transparent black that can withstand long working hours and many flame atmospheres. It work smooth and melts into itself without a trace of layering. It is a bit stiffer than clear when blowing it out or drawing it down. Eclipse stringers are black down to 1mm when they appear to be a dense smoky transparent black. A 2mm or 3mm thick layer of Eclipse over any tubing is enough to create the appearance of a solid black colored tube; keeping the clear underneath helps core heat remain while you work and saves on color versus coiled solid color. Reheating as many times as you want and numerous or long hours of kiln cycles don't seem to be an issue with Eclipse. I used it inside and on the back of large marbles with great results. Basically it\u2019s my new go to black. I use GA Raven all the time and now Eclipse will fill tons of those jobs where really long flame exposure time or atmosphere was previously an issue with how my black looked in the finish of the piece. Eclipse stays really black with a super gloss finish that makes it the best and most workable black I have tried in the color palette for today's lampworker.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

I love Grape for coiling bubbles and making solid color tubing sections, also for solid sculpture and marble work. Grape is one of the only borosilicate colors available that works almost identically to clear glass in the way that it is smooth and creamy, melts easily, holds its heat very well and can be worked for very long amounts of time in the flame and kiln without any fatigue to the surface of the glass. Use with Glass Alchemy Singular Passion for overlays and GA Paparazzi for unique honeycombing and surface patterning.\" - Mike Shelbo",

I have been able to get an array of finishes from different combinations of color layer thickness and kiln time and temperature. Half Blood works well in all hollow and solid applications and under deep encasement.

The vibrancy of this color shows up in different ways when transmitting and reflecting natural light and the high refractive index on it helps the color to pop in certain shapes, similar to fiber optics or prisms.Haterade is able to hold up under all flame atmospheres and in long working times both on the torch and in the kiln.

      "manufacturer_description": "Jackpot is a super saturated sparkle color. If you like Paparazzi but wish it was denser, then Jackpot is the color for you! This color holds up well in encasement and can be mixed with other colors to create custom super sparkle colors! Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975\u00b0 F, Anneal at 1050\u00b0 F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cGA Jackpot has large flakes of sparkle giving this transparent deep money green an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. Whether you stripe, coil, mash, layer, twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changing the \u201clook\u201d or finish. You can achieve a larger flake or sparkle when the rod is applied and worked in flat without much manipulation. This color is great for every application including solid work, with or without encasement. Hollow forms will yield a beautiful array of effects depending on the thickness in color layer. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Jackpot will be transparent yet still lend a lot of sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Jackpot is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result would be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant base color. At any time, a thin layer of clear over Jackpot will often \"brighten\" it up a bit and the encasement always helps amplify the sparkle while leaving your surface clean and crisp. Jackpot can be encased in thick clear for marbles and sculptures. Layer under other more transparent colors such as GA Double Passion and GA Brilliant Blue for wonderful results.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

It is great for all applications and will remain dense when pulled down thin. This color is easy to work and is safe in all applications. Working Tip: Pre-heat in outer flame. Avoid rapid heating. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"What you see is what you get here and what you get is an Olive Green that is straight out of the martini glass. Vibrant green opaque glass that when used with Red Crayon would perfectly replicate the color combo found in that which is shaken not stirred. This color works smooth and creamy. Works like other crayon colors and prefers to be in the mid to outer region of the flame, but can come close to the torch tip in quick passes and light repeated spot heats. Lends well to sculptural work and blown work with 2mm or thicker color application. This color can also be blown thin between two layers of clear for a translucent effect. Olive Green Crayon, 406 when applied onto itself for bitwork or color design build-up, melts in well. It will not sublime or boil if you work it in slowly or help move things along with a graphite or metal tool.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975\u00b0 F, Anneal at 1050\u00b0 F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"With sparkle flakes this big there are a lot of possibilities for the finish with GA Paparazzi. What I am referring to is the fact that if you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble and the tight satin like pattern that is formed. Another possible finish effect with GA Paparazzi is when the rod is applied and worked flat. Without much manipulation, you will see much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the \u201clook\u201d or finish. This color is great for every application including solid with or without encasement. Hollow forms with varying thickness in color layer will yield a beautiful array of effects. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Paparazzi will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finishing look. GA Paparazzi pairs elegantly with GA Half Blood.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Get this color white hot to erase the striking history. A variety of effects are achievable depending on how long you flame/kiln strike. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This rich color has a lot of potential for different finishes depending on whether you kiln strike and/or flame reduce. The base color is similar to GA Triple Passion, but moves into deep purples quickly. This color sometimes reminds me of a concord grape in the way that the light bursts and highlights of ghosty silver-blue appear over a deep warm purple. The purple will become darker and darker the longer it is worked and if your piece goes into the kiln and you still want a darker color, then strike at 1100 F for 15-20 minutes extra. You can always change the look of the top layer of Passion Extreme by blasting a sharp and hot flame onto the surface, immediately cutting through the silver build up and reversing the strike of the \"skin\" of the color. From there it's just in how you expose it to the flame or kiln that will determine the outcome of this wonderful color. Passion Extreme holds up well in blown and solid applications, and thin stringers hold color well. When sandwiched under clear more light blue fumey effects are showcased over the base color. I really like using this color with GA Raven and on top of GA Sno White in a veiled cane.\" - Mike Shelbo",

A variety of effects are achievable depending on how long you flame/kiln strike. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo:\"This wonderful fusion of color could almost be called a ruby Triple Passion. The striking properties range from rubies to purples and blues, yellows and greens. While working the piece you will see continuous color shifts and you should consider how thick your color application is and at what point you would like the color to stop changing. For example, increased kiln time and temp will strike out the rubies and purples leaving you with a different looking piece that went in the kiln. The mixing of results that you will find as you work this color is just gorgeous. I find myself wanting to keep the array of pinks, oranges, rubies and yellows that earned the persimmon reference, but the light greens and blues that show up during the sculpting process compliment the other colors so well, a delicate balance of intense spot heating and reheating is needed to capture the whole range in one piece. I think that a quick annealing at 1030F is called for when you like the look of the piece going into the kiln. (If it is what you are going for and you do not want it to continue to strike get in and out of the kiln without a long hold.) This color is really fun and has moved into my top favorite Glass Alchemy color list.\" - Mike Shelbo",

There were no gray rods available and the pre-forms went almost white... how could you make a believable shark? So we made the first opaque gray; we chose neutral #5 on the gray scale as a starting point. Working Tip: Per-heat in outer flame. Avoid rapid heating. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This medium gray opaque crayon works amazingly well compared to other opaques and is perfect for solid sculpture when used without encasement. It melts into itself very nicely and can be worked in a variety of flame mixes and regions that allow it to be versatile in all applications. When blown thin enough, the gray will become slightly translucent, this effect is best achieved sandwiching between clear and blowing thin or drawing down. Treat Portland Gray as you would other GA Crayon colors. This is the best gray you can find for monochromatic color schemes.\" - Mike Shelbo",

This color works well hollow and solid, layered and on the surface. Raindrop will be stable when encased in clear and the color holds well after being blown out and stretched thin. Once the color layer thickness is below 2mm you have a very light tint. One of my favorite uses is to veil Raindrop over another light color to create pastel shades. When used in sculptural pieces that are exposed to extremely long working times, I recommend a thin encasement of clear over the Raindrop sections. It pairs well with the transparent palette from Glass Alchemy like Haterade, Blue Dream and Grape. \" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cWith large flakes of sparkle, this transparent deep brilliant blue has an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. If you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble. When the rod is applied and worked without much manipulation, it will show much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the \u201clook\u201d or finish. This color is great for every application including solid, with or without encasement, and hollow forms with varying thickness in color. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Sapphire will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Sapphire is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result will be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant blue base color.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

With GA Shamrock being so saturated it lends well to all types of solid and blown work. It works very smoothly and melts without sublimation or any definition of the termination when separated from itself. While I have had success with encasement under a thick layer of clear, I still suggest testing and experimentation when using opaque greens to check if the application works in different circumstances. GA Shamrock pairs well with all other GA Crayon colors, I recommend GA Sno White and GA Rasta Gold. Try encasement of GA Shamrock with other opaques and transparent colors for a variety of different effects when drawn out thin or blown out to thinly veil the Shamrock. An example of this would be a light coating of GA Silver Strike-5 Frit and encasement with clear rod or frit to produce a natural toned effect with an earthy finish.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This transparent what you see is what you get is a warm brown, meaning it has tint of reddish amber to lighten up the color. Sienna is a cinnamon brown that can be predictable and the intensity can be controlled by thickness of color application. When drawing down into stringers you can encase solid clear or color with Sienna and achieve a very light tint, or in blown application get an extremely subtle tint by sandwiching in clear and blowing thin. Sienna handles just like GA Beryl or GA Cobalt 1, in the way that is holds heat well, melts into itself smoothly, and leaves no trace of where color was layered upon itself. Great for blow in or puff and stuff maneuvers when you need a tube of consistent color tone to work with.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Made with Tin Oxide, the spelling of Sno is us getting geeky with a chemistry joke!Working Tip: Heat slowly to raise the core temperature. Once the heat base is established, this color can be worked very hot and any air bubbles that popped during the preheat will smooth out. Getting this color white hot will cause excessive gas release that can not be repaired and should therefore be avoided. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This opaque white crayon is highly saturated with color so that you can draw down to stringers or blow out thin and still have a solid white finish. If desired, Sno White can be sandwiched between clear and blown out very thin and achieve a slightly translucent or milky finish. Without encasement in clear or another color you must work Sno White like other crayon colors and try to do most heating about an inch or so further out than where you work your clear glass. It can handle quick heats with an intense, hot and sharp flame, but do not overheat tiny areas and you will avoid bubbling.Sno White melts into itself smoothly and easily without trace of where color overlaps itself. For thick, solid sculpture work, I prefer to encase clear rod with Sno White so the core of the sculpture is more flexible and can hold core heat longer. Try encasing Sno White in every Glass Alchemy translucent color and find a whole new palette of colors that includes more pastels and can create a bold and vibrant look for your basic what you see is what you get colors.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \u201cStarry Night is similar in sparkle flake, size and structure to Paparazzi and Sapphire, but has the added addition of just the right amount of silver to bring a fume like veil over the surface of your sparkle finish. When working Starry Night you must keep the surface in mind as the silver will push out in a ghost blue transparent cloudiness. You can remove the cloudiness with an intense spot heat, or let it build up to a slightly cream colored fume. Either way, there are loads of sparkles and possibilities for swirling silver into your pieces. I found I liked putting a thick layer of Starry Night over a clear tube, melting it smooth, encasing it with 6mm clear rod and then melting that to either stretch down, or blow out thin. It traps the silver fume and gives a different look to the sparkle than when it is un-encased.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Putting the piece in the kiln at 1075F for different rates of time will strike variations in the color depending on thickness of color application and layering of color throughout the working process. A light yellow transparent will darken to a pinkish orange with subtle reds.If you return any part of the piece to a molten state it will restart the striking process. I like to use this color without encasement. No need to reduce in the flame or work in an oxidizing atmosphere.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Tiger\u2019s Eye has such large sparkle flakes that when you catch it in different light it seems as though you see every color of the rainbow reflecting like a prism. At the same time, you can also see gold and silver flakes. The base color helps a lot with this effect. Similar to Beryl but a bit more vibrant, this transparent color works quite the same. It handles every type of working situation, although you want to avoid long exposure to a heavy propane flame. It can be worked solid or blown, thick or thin.

Working Tip: Work neutral to oxidizing for best results. A reducing flame will cause red streaking. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Tonic is a transparent blue, the color of an aquamarine gem. The color becomes more vibrant and its higher refractive index shows when used with itself in applications that allow the Tonic layer to be as thick as possible. When used as tubing, applied on clear or as coiled color, if the Tonic will be exposed to a lot of different working flames and long times in and out of the kiln, I advise a thin clear coat to protect the surface from overworking. Too much propane in your flame can result in a copper reduction leaving you with red streaks or patches on the surface of the un-encased Tonic. Too much over oxidizing can leave you with a surface haze or scuzz that must be swiped to remove. I often recommend a thin layer of clear frit over Tonic or evenly coated clear rod over your entire prep. I have used Tonic without encasement many times on solid sculpture and had good results, but I have seen a warming or flashing flame haze up a section. Working Tonic in as close to a neutral flame and away from the face of your torch is wise and will get you the best results with the color. If you have worked Raindrop in the past, this color is very similar in working properties. My favorite application is to gather up rods into 18mm or thicker sections and sculpt them into figurines. This next generation transparent is definitely a must have to fill out the rainbow palette. It can be layered over other colors like white for a nice pastel, but will be a faint tint unless applied as a 5-7mm thick layer. The first impression Tonic made on me was the thought that it was the color of window glass or old soda bottles, both aqua blue colors that I have always been fond of.\u201d \u2013 Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"You know it, you love it, and you can use it so many ways! Triple Passion is a striking color full of silver goodness. This means that as your translucent base glass shifts from a golden yellow to amber and into purples and violets you will also see a reaction from the silver adding in blue and green and purple hues. To best understand how this will work as you make your piece, heat your color rod to a molten state, let it cool, then with a normal working flame heat for a second at a time and pause in between to watch results. The striking happens quickly and that is why short exposure increments will yield large differences. Encase with clear to trap luster and pearlescent qualities.

The density of the color will stay true to the color of the rod before manipulation but when blown, it can become a milky translucent and opalescent version of itself. This is best achieved by sandwiching between clear and blowing thin. Turquoise works creamy but the slightest bit stiffer than other opaques. Overworking the surface of the color when not encased in clear can lead to undesired surface texture and finish. However, when desired you can use a reduction flame with heavy propane on unencased Turquoise before you put your piece in the annealer to bring out the copper, which will result in very natural toned red tints and streaks interacting with your base color.\" - Mike Shelbo",
