Blue Honey is the rarest of all honeys because it comes from the Blue Bumble Bee. The Blue Bumble Bee first came about when a guy named Dave used to play the blues for fields of wild flowers. All of those wild flowers started taking in the blues and created blue pollen which the local bumble bees used to make their hives with. After many seasons of Dave playing the blues for the buzzing and bumbling locals he noticed that these bees had turned blue. They were a more laid back kind of bee. Dave checked out their hive one day after following one of these blue dudes back to their den where he found the Blue Honey.",

Stringers come in 0.5 mm (“Fine Line”), 1 mm, and 2 mm thicknesses and are approximately 17.75\" (451 mm) long. They are packed in clear plastic tubes that are 18\" (457 mm) long and 0.75\" (19 mm) in diameter. Tubes are packaged by volume. A tube of .0.5 mm stringer contains approximately 350 pieces. A tube of 1 mm stringers contains approximately 123 pieces. A tube of 2 mm stringer contains approximately 50 pieces. Tubes of colors made with gold contain fewer stringers, to reduce unit price. For example, a tube of gold-bearing 1 mm stringers contains approximately 87 pieces, while a tube of 2 mm stringers contains approximately 33 pieces. Like our sheet glass, stringers are made by hand. There may be slight variation in color, thickness, length, etc.",

Where there is less yellow glass [like in the scroll bead] the yellow is paler, whereas in the spacers and the raised flower, it has a much deeper hue.

It is made in USA without Antimony, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Nickel, or Selenium. Rods are dark blue but strike to black during the annealing cycle. Stays neutral with striking colors but reacts to luster colors. For maximum opacity, particularly in thin applications, briefly cool the bead then lightly flame strike (30 seconds) before annealing for 2 hours or more at 950F. The Oracle projec t is an extension of what we’ve already done with Aether, Zephyr and Rhea; create low-toxicity, essential glass colors for the flame. We will be producing colors free from antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and selenium. Oracle-Black, Oracle-White (coming in 2018), Rhea, and Zephyr give 104 flame workers the option to use responsibly manufactured, low toxicity glasses in their work. Stunning.

Encased applications: encase, reset, cool for 45 seconds, strike for 45-60 seconds. The cooling cycle is an important factor in repeatable end results.

It is going to vary from person to person. Here is my process. 1) Shape bead 2) Allow bead to cool for 20 seconds. 3) Adjust flame so candles are stretched 2mm from neutral. 4) Pass bead through flame, candles should touch bead and deflect yellow flame around the edges. 1.5 seconds duration for each pass. 5) Allow bead to cool 5 seconds between passes. 6) Repeat pass-through and cooling cycle 5-15 times. 7) Anneal.",

With a (relatively) high resistance to thermal shock, 740.opl can be worked hot and fast in the torch flame. It is significantly stiffer than a typical opaque white glass, making it suitable for sculptural work, bead cores, and stringers. Working notes: -To retain the transparent opal effect, reset before annealing and limit kiln temperature and annealing time. I use 930F for less than an hour for misty-opal beads. -740.opl can be used as a core in place of opaque white glasses. For maximum opacity, anneal at 950F for 2 hours of more. Clear encasement seems to accelerate opacification in the annealer. The 740.opl’s reset and striking temperatures are lower than that of silver glasses. When reset, the glass is crystal clear, and when fully struck the glass is opaque white.

We are pushing this color's boundaries, making it as dense as possible, while keeping it an acidic lemony yellow. If you want a more traditional yellow, try Yellow Crayon. Working Tip: Pre-heat in outer flame. Avoid rapid heating Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This very bright opaque yellow will stay true when drawn down to smaller cane sizes and will not transmit light unless the application of color is thinner than 2mm. This color works great in the neutral flame region and can handle all flame atmospheres for short amounts of time. Do not use a highly reducing flame or a very sharp hot flame without quick movement of the color; this will avoid any possibility of minor boil spots. The vibrancy of Acid Yellow Crayon is a wonderful backing to many Glass Alchemy transparent colors, also a very complimentary color to the other opaques, and desirable for murine applications as well. Encasement in clear is not necessary but can be used to increase yield on size of solid or blown work and allow for more intense working conditions.\" - Mike Shelbo",

I know that it is one of the most popular Glass Alchemy colors and the reason is because no matter which way you work it, the results are fantastic. I use it for murrine, solid sculpture, blown work on clear tubing or coil potted and with or without encasement in clear. Agua Azul holds its color as it is drawn out into stringers and is applied smoothly and works creamy. When blown extremely thin you can see slight translucent qualities and minuscule air bubbles, but this only shows when not encased and blown thinner than 1mm.

Working Tip: Flame or kiln strike 1075F. Work neutral; reduce at end for metallic effects. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"The potential for variations of finishes is the best part about Amazon Bronze. I usually work the glass in the center of the distance between my torch tip and the end of the flame (the neutral flame zone), leaving me with a deep reddish brown. Then when the piece is completed and ready to put away I will increase propane in the flame and flash the piece in and out of the fire to bring the metallic reduction to the surface. This has yielded metallic colors ranging from a shiny copper penny to a beautiful rainbow iridescence. You can also repeatedly kiln your finished piece at 1040F to 1100F to achieve a metallic effect, leaving a slight luster finish of blues and purples and sometimes cream and green on top of your underlying dense browns and reds. Amazon Bronze looks awesome without being encased or underneath clear or other transparent colors.\" - Mike Shelbo",

For all of you that fit into this category, we created Amazon Lagoon, 587. This color was designed to put the \"surprise\" back into working silver borosilicate colors. Every piece will be beautiful, every piece will be different. Working Tip: Work in neutral flame and have fun, this one is loaded with silver! Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Amazon Lagoon is a very deep cobalt base glass packed with tons of silver. Encasement of the rod in clear will result in trapping pearlescent greens and blues and some golden oranges and cream yellows. Depending on working time and whether the piece is solid or blown, you will see a range of finishes and shifting of colors. In a neutral working atmosphere the silver will come to the surface when not encased in clear. Color ranging from dark blue to yellow green pastel will sometimes have streaks of cool colors on the surface. When your piece is done you can reduce lightly and watch the metallic finish emerge in golds, silvers, greens, bronzes and blues depending on color layer thickness and amount of reduction given.\" - Mike Shelbo",

I love to encase this color with clear on a piece that will be worked for a couple hours. Reheating the area of Amazon Night in different ways (ex: sharp intense spot heat, or all over) will change the results of the silver trying to emerge through the clear layer. Bursts, streaks, wisps and smooth gradients will appear in all colors of blues, greens, purples, and golden yellow.When working Amazon Night without encasement, make sure not to overwork in a reducing atmosphere or in an over oxidizing flame to avoid phase separation or scum.

Working Tip: Work this color like you would Triple Passion or a similar striking color. Since this color also has chrome it in work it in a neutral flame and garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “Andromeda is a transparent green sparkle that strikes when heated to a transparent amber that will continue to strike to a deep purple, if the layer of color is thick enough. In addition to the base color there is sparkle and silver that will fume the surface of the color as it gets worked. You can treat Andromeda similar to GA Triple Passion and use an intense, sharp flame to burn off the silver fume on the surface if you wish to show the brilliance of the sparkle in the finish of your piece. You can get a range of finishes with this color without encasement, depending on how long the color is worked and in what flame atmosphere. I have found that when encased in clear, Andromeda handles very well and the clear can often intensify the sparkle. If worked before encasement you can trap silver fuming off the color and have a milky blue ghostly veil over your sparkle green or purple. The sparkle flakes in Andromeda seem to reflect a rainbow of color, ending in gold. The color can be manipulated by twisting, compressing, layering and thinning the amount of color used and how it is worked into your piece, resulting in a number of finishing looks. When kiln striking the base color to shift into deeper colors try 1100 degrees Fahrenheit for short intervals of time until you see the desired results. Andromeda pairs well with GA Eclipse and GA Grape.” – Mike Shelbo",

An over oxidizing sharp hot flame setting may scum or boil when repeatedly immersed into the fire. To best avoid unwanted effects, either work your piece in the middle of the length of your torch flame or pre-encase with clear. When Aquatic Carnival is on the surface you can repeatedly reduce in the torch flame to bring out an array of color and effects. Try rotating the area you want reduced until a soft orange glow (not molten) appears, then remove from flame and wait a moment to see the result. Reduction at the end of the creation process yields completely different results than a piece worked in a reduction flame the whole time it was made. Bursts and gradients of greens and blues on the top of the deep teal creates beautiful tones, very reminiscent of water and the play of light on the ocean.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Work in neutral flame to avoid reduction (red streaks). Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This is one of my favorite translucent WYSIWYG colors. This brownish olive green transparent is wonderful for solid color sculpting and works very nicely for blown work as well. For larger blown work, I recommend sandwiching between a clear tube and another layer of clear or transparent color, reason being that Beryl is made up of a significant amount of copper. When a heavy copper color is not encased and on the surface for blown work that will be melted, blown, and manipulated it will tend to react with different amounts of propane and oxygen in your flame mix. So where Beryl may feel similar to working clear, it will prefer working about halfway to three quarters of the flame length away from the tip of your torch in an even mix of gas. Heavy reduction or propane in the flame mix, very close to the tip of your torch, will react with the copper in the color causing different surface effects. A very natural tone for your color palette, Beryl will compliment many other Glass Alchemy colors and when standing alone should be given the opportunity for light to transmit through the color for best presentation.\" - Mike Shelbo",

This color works nicely as it melts easily and will smooth into itself without trace of where application overlaps.

      "manufacturer_description": "A great addition to the Glass Alchemy transparent palette, Blue Dream is a vibrant bold blue that looks great sculpted and really pops. Working Tip: Try layering Blue Dream to achieve a blue tint, or using it in thick solid sections to achieve a vibrant blue. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Blue Dream is a vibrant and transparent blue. It is a stable WYSIWYG. The color becomes more intense as the layer of thickness is built up to about 8mm or more. If thinned out to a stringer or 4mm or less, the color becomes a lighter tint. With a higher refractive index, I use this color mostly as solid bits and thicker tubing sections. I found it to be quite optically clear and mostly air-free. If you are a fan of Brilliant Blue, then you will love this more transparent shade of bright cobalt. It can be exposed to many flame atmospheres and working conditions without any concern. I would not recommend an overly heavy propane flame for a long working time, but Blue Dream seems to be quite resilient to reduction issues other cobalt’s may have. Blue Dream compliments Sno White and pairs well with Haterade, Raindrop, and GA’s other transparents.\" - Mike Shelbo",

When drawn down into extremely thin threads, it will still remain a deep cobalt blue transparent. Keep Cobalt-6 in the outer region of your flame length, in a mix of gas that will not reduce the color if used without encasement. Grey streaks or patches could develop from too much propane in your torch flame, so using a neutral flame is best. Cobalt-6 can be sandwiched between clear and blown out very thin while still having an intensely deep cobalt blue color.

Using next level production techniques, Crippy has a high refractive index and optical clarity found in our Next-Gen line. Working Tip: For best results, work in a neutral flame. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: ﻿\"Crippy is a rich and vibrant transparent green that has little to zero air content and high clarity. This color is extremely workable in all situations including hollow, solid and long working projects. It can be used with or without encasement in clear. It is crucial in the rainbow palette of Next-Generation Transparents from Glass Alchemy and when blending with other cool colors. Crippy can be blown out thin for a strong green tint over clear, white or other colors. This color is great for layering and fades as well. Don't overwork in a heavy propane flame and on a project with long working time, lower your kiln holding temperature to 980-1015 F, until it's time to anneal at 1040 F. Crippy is beautiful when paired with Sno White, Lemon Drop or Purple Rain as well as many other colors both opaque and transparent.\" - Mike Shelbo",

      "manufacturer_description": "Disco Sparkle, 9958 is an exciting sparkle color. It is a concentrated silver metallic color in a clear base. This allows Disco Sparkle, 9958 to be mixed into almost any color. While many people use the color full strength, others mix it down as much as 10 parts of clear (or color) to 1 part of Disco Sparkle, 9958. Even if using the rod full strength it is best to remix the color prior to using for a smooth, highly reflective surface. Working Tip: Disco likes to be worked cool as to avoid yellowing... Treat it like a Crayon color. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This is the sparkle color of all sparkle colors. Glass Alchemy created this color for several reasons. It can be worked into and mixed with other colors to create your own new sparkle colors. Disco Sparkle can be worked without encasement for an extremely dense sparkle finish that is smooth to the touch but looks as though there is a textured surface. For a wide variety of uses, I melt and condense a rod of 7mm Disco Sparkle into smaller thicker sections and use a thin encasement of clear 3mm rod and redraw out to desired cane size, usually about 4mm. This leaves you with an easily workable and still very dense sparkle finish. Take the ratio of five inches of 7mm clear rod and a half inch of Disco Sparkle and mix thoroughly for the look of a light amount of sparkle needed to accent or encase another color. If you plan to blow Disco Sparkle out into thin bubbles make sure to encase in clear. Disco Sparkle can also handle encasement under thick clear.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This transparent color can strike and shift in color simultaneously because of the perfect mix of ingredients similar to those found in Triple Passion. Striking a bit slower than its Triple counterpart, you can see more yellows, ambers, oranges and pinks. The amount of silver in the color allows you to have a surface buildup of wispy and cloudy bursts of light blues and cream colors that can be controlled by the amount of propane in your torch flame setting. When worked very hot, you are left with an intense pink or magenta color. Your Double Passion will transmit light of different colors depending on how much the base color strikes and how much silver you let rest on the surface.

Dragon’s Blood will strike to a deeper red in the flame or kiln Artist Description by Mike Shelbo:\"This is a color I have been waiting to get my hands on for some time. It is a self striking deep ruby that does not over strike or liver. Dragon's Blood can be used in all applications such as surface work, inside out, solid or hollow sculpture and can be diluted to different consistencies for a brighter ruby finish. An example of this is that the goblin head bead is coiled Dragon's Blood and while still transparent enough to let light transmit through, it strikes to the perfect deep ruby that is dark enough to seem opaque. When experimenting with Dragon's Blood I covered a point of one inch heavy wall clear tube with it and blew it out thin to achieve a lighter, brighter, perfect ruby. When sandwiched between clear layers and blown out you can see the color goes a long way and with the self striking quality of the glass, you are able to see what you can expect from different ratios of color to clear.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This color can be worked either unencased or encased. When working this color unencased I advise using a flame that has a bit more oxygen in the mix than your normal settings. This will allow you to use reduction properly at the end of the piece by increasing the amount of propane in your torch flame. Through reduction your transparent green base glass will push out colors ranging from creamy blues and greens to yellows, oranges, and purples to a metallic rainbow iridescence.

Working Tip: This color can handle different flame atmospheres but as always, we recommend working in a neutral flame. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “Eclipse is a dense, transparent black that can withstand long working hours and many flame atmospheres. It work smooth and melts into itself without a trace of layering. It is a bit stiffer than clear when blowing it out or drawing it down. Eclipse stringers are black down to 1mm when they appear to be a dense smoky transparent black. A 2mm or 3mm thick layer of Eclipse over any tubing is enough to create the appearance of a solid black colored tube; keeping the clear underneath helps core heat remain while you work and saves on color versus coiled solid color. Reheating as many times as you want and numerous or long hours of kiln cycles don't seem to be an issue with Eclipse. I used it inside and on the back of large marbles with great results. Basically it’s my new go to black. I use GA Raven all the time and now Eclipse will fill tons of those jobs where really long flame exposure time or atmosphere was previously an issue with how my black looked in the finish of the piece. Eclipse stays really black with a super gloss finish that makes it the best and most workable black I have tried in the color palette for today's lampworker.” – Mike Shelbo",

I love Grape for coiling bubbles and making solid color tubing sections, also for solid sculpture and marble work. Grape is one of the only borosilicate colors available that works almost identically to clear glass in the way that it is smooth and creamy, melts easily, holds its heat very well and can be worked for very long amounts of time in the flame and kiln without any fatigue to the surface of the glass.

I have always been a fan of deep copper rubies and when GA Half Blood emerged I was excited to have a beautiful striking copper ruby that was more prone to staying vibrant and transparent than going dark or toward liver when worked for a long time. I have been able to get an array of finishes from different combinations of color layer thickness and kiln time and temperature.

Haterade can act as a tint over clear or color; you can also gather it up for thick lenses or colored tubing. When drawn down to a stringer, Haterade will be a very light green. The vibrancy of this color shows up in different ways when transmitting and reflecting natural light and the high refractive index on it helps the color to pop in certain shapes, similar to fiber optics or prisms.Haterade is able to hold up under all flame atmospheres and in long working times both on the torch and in the kiln. Haterade is beautiful when paired next to the lineup of GA Purple Rain, GA Rozay, GA Brilliant Blue and Lemon Drop, among others for the candy clear transparent palette.” – Mike Shelbo",

      "manufacturer_description": "Jackpot is a super saturated sparkle color. If you like Paparazzi but wish it was denser, then Jackpot is the color for you! This color holds up well in encasement and can be mixed with other colors to create custom super sparkle colors! Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “GA Jackpot has large flakes of sparkle giving this transparent deep money green an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. Whether you stripe, coil, mash, layer, twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changing the “look” or finish. You can achieve a larger flake or sparkle when the rod is applied and worked in flat without much manipulation. This color is great for every application including solid work, with or without encasement. Hollow forms will yield a beautiful array of effects depending on the thickness in color layer. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Jackpot will be transparent yet still lend a lot of sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Jackpot is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result would be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant base color. At any time, a thin layer of clear over Jackpot will often \"brighten\" it up a bit and the encasement always helps amplify the sparkle while leaving your surface clean and crisp. Jackpot can be encased in thick clear for marbles and sculptures. Layer under other more transparent colors such as GA Double Passion and GA Brilliant Blue for wonderful results.” – Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"With sparkle flakes this big there are a lot of possibilities for the finish with GA Paparazzi. What I am referring to is the fact that if you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble and the tight satin like pattern that is formed. Another possible finish effect with GA Paparazzi is when the rod is applied and worked flat. Without much manipulation, you will see much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the “look” or finish. This color is great for every application including solid with or without encasement. Hollow forms with varying thickness in color layer will yield a beautiful array of effects. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Paparazzi will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finishing look. GA Paparazzi pairs elegantly with GA Half Blood.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Get this color white hot to erase the striking history. A variety of effects are achievable depending on how long you flame/kiln strike. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This rich color has a lot of potential for different finishes depending on whether you kiln strike and/or flame reduce. The base color is similar to GA Triple Passion, but moves into deep purples quickly. This color sometimes reminds me of a concord grape in the way that the light bursts and highlights of ghosty silver-blue appear over a deep warm purple. The purple will become darker and darker the longer it is worked and if your piece goes into the kiln and you still want a darker color, then strike at 1100 F for 15-20 minutes extra. You can always change the look of the top layer of Passion Extreme by blasting a sharp and hot flame onto the surface, immediately cutting through the silver build up and reversing the strike of the \"skin\" of the color. From there it's just in how you expose it to the flame or kiln that will determine the outcome of this wonderful color. Passion Extreme holds up well in blown and solid applications, and thin stringers hold color well. When sandwiched under clear more light blue fumey effects are showcased over the base color. I really like using this color with GA Raven and on top of GA Sno White in a veiled cane.\" - Mike Shelbo",

A variety of effects are achievable depending on how long you flame/kiln strike. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo:\"This wonderful fusion of color could almost be called a ruby Triple Passion. The striking properties range from rubies to purples and blues, yellows and greens. While working the piece you will see continuous color shifts and you should consider how thick your color application is and at what point you would like the color to stop changing. For example, increased kiln time and temp will strike out the rubies and purples leaving you with a different looking piece that went in the kiln. The mixing of results that you will find as you work this color is just gorgeous. I find myself wanting to keep the array of pinks, oranges, rubies and yellows that earned the persimmon reference, but the light greens and blues that show up during the sculpting process compliment the other colors so well, a delicate balance of intense spot heating and reheating is needed to capture the whole range in one piece. I think that a quick annealing at 1030F is called for when you like the look of the piece going into the kiln. (If it is what you are going for and you do not want it to continue to strike get in and out of the kiln without a long hold.) This color is really fun and has moved into my top favorite Glass Alchemy color list.\" - Mike Shelbo",

This color works well hollow and solid, layered and on the surface. Raindrop will be stable when encased in clear and the color holds well after being blown out and stretched thin. Once the color layer thickness is below 2mm you have a very light tint. One of my favorite uses is to veil Raindrop over another light color to create pastel shades. When used in sculptural pieces that are exposed to extremely long working times, I recommend a thin encasement of clear over the Raindrop sections.

Try moving the rod away from the torch tip while running a sharp hot flame if you are trying to weld or spot heat for detail and you want a perfect melt.This color compliments and contrasts well with Shamrock, 4494 as well as many opaque and transparent Glass Alchemy Cobalts and Blues, as well as the other warm Glass Alchemy Crayon colors.\" - Mike Shelbo",

For a saturated black, this is a surprisingly easy color to melt and shape. It does contain chrome, so be sure to take this into consideration. If you want a chrome free black, check out Eclipse, 9977. Eclipse is less saturated than Raven, but is a highly workable chrome free black. Working Tip: Work in neutral flame. If you flash heat in a reducing flame as you finish the project you can produce a look similar to the sheen of a raven's wing. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This super saturated opaque black is the answer to your need for thin stringer work and dense overlays that need to be black when blown out thin. It handles nice and smooth, also a bit stiffer than some other opaques but not by much. Raven can not be worked in heavy reduction for long periods of time without encasement. When used in a neutral flame in the correct region of the flame, this color will respond well and leave you with a beautiful finish. Treat Raven as you would other GA Crayon colors and you will get clean results.Great for backing marbles, deep encasement, inside out work, and stuff and puff techniques. I like using Raven with so many other Glass Alchemy colors, but my favorite combo is with Haterade for encalmo work.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This color is a what you see is what you get opaque and falls inline between Peacock and Agua Azul. The characteristics of working this color are just what you would expect from Agua Azul. It has a slight stiffness at first when melting but like the others, it melts easily and smoothly. It will hold up well in stringers and thin blown applications. When blown and stretched thin enough Really Teally will become translucent and allow light to pass through it. Really Teally can be used with or without encasement in clear. Building up solid sections for sculptural bits shows how well the color melts into itself and also how well it holds heat. Really Teally is workable in all flame settings and can handle intense spot heats without concern of sublimation or boil. For getting the most bang for your buck with this color you can sandwich it between clear layers for blown and solid applications and still yield the same density and look of color in your finished piece.

Working the color without encasement in the outer flame is ideal but quick passes in a sharp hot flame closer to your torch tip also works. Red Crayon works smooth and melts down without any potential sublimination if you have a bit of patience and keep from concentrating a sharp hot flame on one spot. It requires time to warm up and allow the heat to penetrate past the surface of the color. In other words think of your flame as a small brush and move lightly around the area you intend to get molten in a spot heat situation. This color works well for blown and sculptural work and murrine. When encased between two layers of clear glass you can blow out quite thin before color starts to become translucent.

Rozay can act as a tint over clear or color; you can also gather it up for thick lenses or colored tubing. When drawn down to a stringer, Rozay will be a very light pink. The vibrancy of this color shows up in different ways when transmitting and reflecting natural light. Its high refractive index helps the color \"pop\" in certain shapes, similar to fiber optics or prisms. Rozay is also able to hold up under all flame atmospheres and in long working times both on the torch and in the kiln.

Working Tip: This color likes to be worked cool, but make sure you have your heat base built up while tooling or manipulating the glass to avoid developing a gray haze. As with all chrome colors. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “With large flakes of sparkle, this transparent deep brilliant blue has an intense shimmer and wide spectrum of reflective color. If you stripe, coil, mash, layer and twist or swirl this color you can actually see the effect in the look of the sparkle. An example would be the tight satin like pattern that is formed when compressing the rod while spinning one direction without encasement into a marble. When the rod is applied and worked without much manipulation, it will show much larger flakes of sparkle. Think of each sparkle flake as a small flat chip that can either be stacked on top of one another or laid side by side, each manipulation changes the “look” or finish. This color is great for every application including solid, with or without encasement, and hollow forms with varying thickness in color. When blown thin or stretched down into a thin stringer or veil, Sapphire will be very transparent yet still lend sparkle to the finished look. Do not use an extremely high mix of propane when Sapphire is being worked for long periods of time in the flame without encasement, the result will be a slight grey just on top of your brilliant blue base color.” – Mike Shelbo",

With GA Shamrock being so saturated it lends well to all types of solid and blown work. It works very smoothly and melts without sublimation or any definition of the termination when separated from itself. While I have had success with encasement under a thick layer of clear, I still suggest testing and experimentation when using opaque greens to check if the application works in different circumstances. GA Shamrock pairs well with all other GA Crayon colors, I recommend GA Sno White and GA Rasta Gold. Try encasement of GA Shamrock with other opaques and transparent colors for a variety of different effects when drawn out thin or blown out to thinly veil the Shamrock. An example of this would be a light coating of GA Silver Strike-5 Frit and encasement with clear rod or frit to produce a natural toned effect with an earthy finish.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Sienna is a cinnamon brown that can be predictable and the intensity can be controlled by thickness of color application. When drawing down into stringers you can encase solid clear or color with Sienna and achieve a very light tint, or in blown application get an extremely subtle tint by sandwiching in clear and blowing thin. Sienna handles just like GA Beryl or GA Cobalt 1, in the way that is holds heat well, melts into itself smoothly, and leaves no trace of where color was layered upon itself.

      "manufacturer_description": "Sno White is a dense, opaque white. Made with Tin Oxide, the spelling of Sno is us getting geeky with a chemistry joke!Working Tip: Heat slowly to raise the core temperature. Once the heat base is established, this color can be worked very hot and any air bubbles that popped during the preheat will smooth out. Getting this color white hot will cause excessive gas release that can not be repaired and should therefore be avoided. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This opaque white crayon is highly saturated with color so that you can draw down to stringers or blow out thin and still have a solid white finish. If desired, Sno White can be sandwiched between clear and blown out very thin and achieve a slightly translucent or milky finish. Without encasement in clear or another color you must work Sno White like other crayon colors and try to do most heating about an inch or so further out than where you work your clear glass. It can handle quick heats with an intense, hot and sharp flame, but do not overheat tiny areas and you will avoid bubbling.Sno White melts into itself smoothly and easily without trace of where color overlaps itself. For thick, solid sculpture work, I prefer to encase clear rod with Sno White so the core of the sculpture is more flexible and can hold core heat longer. Try encasing Sno White in every Glass Alchemy translucent color and find a whole new palette of colors that includes more pastels and can create a bold and vibrant look for your basic what you see is what you get colors.\" - Mike Shelbo",

As with all chrome colors, we suggest you work this color in a neutral flame. Garage at 975° F, Anneal at 1050° F. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: “Starry Night is similar in sparkle flake, size and structure to Paparazzi and Sapphire, but has the added addition of just the right amount of silver to bring a fume like veil over the surface of your sparkle finish. When working Starry Night you must keep the surface in mind as the silver will push out in a ghost blue transparent cloudiness. You can remove the cloudiness with an intense spot heat, or let it build up to a slightly cream colored fume. Either way, there are loads of sparkles and possibilities for swirling silver into your pieces. I found I liked putting a thick layer of Starry Night over a clear tube, melting it smooth, encasing it with 6mm clear rod and then melting that to either stretch down, or blow out thin. It traps the silver fume and gives a different look to the sparkle than when it is un-encased.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Working Tip: Work neutral to oxidizing for best results. A reducing flame will cause red streaking. Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"Tonic is a transparent blue, the color of an aquamarine gem. The color becomes more vibrant and its higher refractive index shows when used with itself in applications that allow the Tonic layer to be as thick as possible. When used as tubing, applied on clear or as coiled color, if the Tonic will be exposed to a lot of different working flames and long times in and out of the kiln, I advise a thin clear coat to protect the surface from overworking. Too much propane in your flame can result in a copper reduction leaving you with red streaks or patches on the surface of the un-encased Tonic. Too much over oxidizing can leave you with a surface haze or scuzz that must be swiped to remove. I often recommend a thin layer of clear frit over Tonic or evenly coated clear rod over your entire prep. I have used Tonic without encasement many times on solid sculpture and had good results, but I have seen a warming or flashing flame haze up a section. Working Tonic in as close to a neutral flame and away from the face of your torch is wise and will get you the best results with the color. If you have worked Raindrop in the past, this color is very similar in working properties. My favorite application is to gather up rods into 18mm or thicker sections and sculpt them into figurines. This next generation transparent is definitely a must have to fill out the rainbow palette. It can be layered over other colors like white for a nice pastel, but will be a faint tint unless applied as a 5-7mm thick layer. The first impression Tonic made on me was the thought that it was the color of window glass or old soda bottles, both aqua blue colors that I have always been fond of.” – Mike Shelbo",

Overworking the surface of the color when not encased in clear can lead to undesired surface texture and finish.

This blue is a deep, opaque color that is darker than Peacock, but still a very distinct blue that has a special place in the color palette. It works great for sculpting solid work and for blown work. Twilight lends well to many styles of application. I also like Twilight for murrine because of the density of the color and the ability to hold up well when drawn down to different sizes. Working this color properly is the same as working other opaques and Crayon colors. Twilight does not sublime or boil and can be intensely spot heated with a sharp flame for detail and welds. Small variations in darker tones emerge with intense spot heating when color is not encased.\" - Mike Shelbo",

A deep rich opaque brown, this color works well in many applications and has become an important part of our lineup. Working Tip: Work in neutral flame to avoid reduction (gray wisps). Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This color is a saturated what you see is what you get opaque deep brown. It works very nicely in all flame atmospheres and in both blown and solid work. It melts into itself easily and is great for detail applied by stringers and in larger applications. Walnut seems opaque but when blown thin or applied in very thin stringers it will show its translucent quality. It can be worked for long periods of time without encasement and with heavy manipulation. This is one of the staple colors in the earth toned palette Glass Alchemy has to offer.\" - Mike Shelbo",

Artist Description by Mike Shelbo: \"This color is a true yellow opaque. It's very natural and has an earthy tone to it. Not too dark, not too bright, Yellow Crayon is just right. Works like other crayon colors and prefers to be in the mid to outer region of the flame but can come close to the torch tip in quick passes and light repeated spot heats. The color density holds well in stringers, canework, and murrine. Blowing with Yellow Crayon works well with encasement or color on the surface of your piece and will stay dense until the color layer is blown thinner than 1mm.

If you’re looking for a tricky color – this is probably the trickiest I’m continuing to learn to date. There’s some resources online, but to bring them here: As it’s worked, it strikes from black to blue to white. If you lay on dots of clear / color over this color, it will seek towards that strike rapidly. This makes it not too ideal for encasement, so proceed with caution on that front. If you love NS-127 I’d say play with this color. Just don’t invest yourself into your first couple/few pieces with it until you learn how it plays. This color’s a whole different beast in terms of its striking nature. I use in my solid work, pendants mostly. You don’t have to do much of anything to get the range of colors. Customers are very attracted to the color. If used on a blown piece I never melt it totally in. I haven’t found the mix of gas to matter.

When reset it is crystal clear and when fully struck it’s milky opaque white. Areas that have started to opacify in the flame will continue to opacify in the annealer. Striking temperatures are lower than that of our silver glasses. Working notes: This slow opal stays mostly reset during many beadmaking operations, and will strike to a misty-opal during annealing. I anneal this color at 975°F for up to five hours for misty-opal beads, depending on size, encasement, and other factors. Your kiln is probably different than mine. Test beads are recommended. -Jed at Double Helix Glassworks",
