## ðŸ’¡ Ideas for WordPress Automation

### Option 1: WordPress REST API
**Pros:**
- Direct API access to WordPress
- Can upload media and update pages programmatically
- No manual FTP needed

**Cons:**
- Requires API authentication setup
- Need to enable WordPress REST API

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Upload image via REST API
curl -X POST https://moltenglass.app/wp-json/wp/v2/media \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@screenshot.png"

# Update page content
curl -X POST https://moltenglass.app/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/PAGE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d "content=<img src='...'/>"
```

### Option 2: FTP/SFTP Upload
**Pros:**
- Simple and direct
- Works with any WordPress hosting
- Can automate with shell script

**Cons:**
- Still need to update page content manually (unless using file-based includes)
- Less integrated

**Implementation:**
```bash
# SFTP upload
lftp -u username,password sftp://moltenglass.app << EOF
cd public_html/wp-content/uploads/screenshots
mput Screenshots/*.png
bye
EOF
```

### Option 3: WordPress CLI (WP-CLI)
**Pros:**
- Command-line WordPress management
- Very powerful for bulk operations
- Can create/update posts and pages

**Cons:**
- Requires SSH access to server
- May need hosting provider support

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Upload media
wp media import screenshot.png --title="Catalog View"

# Update page
wp post update 123 --post_content="<img src='...'/>"
```

### Option 4: Git + WordPress Plugin
**Pros:**
- Version control for website content
- Automated deployment via GitHub Actions
- Modern workflow

**Cons:**
- Requires WordPress plugin setup (e.g., WP Pusher, Git Updater)
- More complex initial setup

**Implementation:**
- Push screenshots to GitHub repo
- WordPress plugin auto-syncs changes
- Pages update automatically

## ðŸ“‹ Questions to Answer

1. **What WordPress hosting provider are you using?**
   - WordPress.com, Bluehost, SiteGround, self-hosted, other?

2. **Do you have access to:**
   - [ ] WordPress admin panel
   - [ ] FTP/SFTP credentials
   - [ ] SSH/terminal access to server
   - [ ] WordPress REST API (can enable if needed)

3. **What page builder/editor are you using?**
   - [ ] Classic WordPress editor
   - [ ] Gutenberg (block editor)
   - [ ] Elementor, Divi, or other page builder
   - [ ] Custom HTML/theme

4. **How frequently will you update screenshots?**
   - [ ] Often (weekly/monthly) â†’ Automation critical
   - [ ] Occasionally (quarterly/yearly) â†’ Manual might be OK
   - [ ] Major releases only â†’ Semi-automated

5. **Do you want fully automated deployment or just simplified upload?**
   - [ ] Fully automated (run script, site updates automatically)
   - [ ] Semi-automated (script uploads, you arrange on page)
   - [ ] Just simplify upload (no manual download/upload)

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach (TBD)

_To be determined based on answers to questions above._
