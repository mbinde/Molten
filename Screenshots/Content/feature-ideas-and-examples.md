# Feature Ideas & Use Case Examples

This document tracks real user use cases and feature ideas to incorporate into the website's Features section.

## Real User Use Cases (from creator)

These are verbatim use cases from the app creator describing why they built Molten:

1. **Look up glass characteristics in the studio**
   - Details like striking temperature, reduction properties, heat sensitivity
   - Note: Artists already know COE - it's the specialized details they need quick access to

2. **Inventory tracking and reordering**
   - Keep track of what inventory I have
   - Remember to re-order when I get low

3. **Shopping list by store**
   - Make sure when buying glass that I get everything I need from that store
   - Don't forget anything when shopping

4. **Track custom creations**
   - Track murrini I've made for myself
   - **FUTURE FEATURE IDEA**: Custom frit blends (currently not in app, but excellent example)

5. **Save ideas and find them later**
   - Write down ideas to try
   - Find them again when I'm in the studio

6. **Store techniques and recipes**
   - Store directions for how to make my favorite things
   - Keep recipes in one place

7. **Project history by glass type**
   - When looking up a particular glass color, see what I made in the past with it
   - Visual history of how different glasses have worked in completed projects

## Feature Examples to Add to Website

These are great examples of "cool ways to use the app" that should be documented in the Features section:

### Catalog Feature
- **Quick reference while working**: Access striking temperatures and reduction properties without leaving the studio
- **Heat sensitivity warnings**: Know which glasses need special handling before you start working

### Inventory Feature
- **Visual project history**: When browsing a glass type, see photos of past projects made with it
- **Past performance tracking**: Remember how a particular color looked in finished work

### Project Log Feature
- **Custom blends documentation**: Track custom frit blends you've created (future feature)
- **Technique library**: Store step-by-step instructions for favorite techniques
- **Recipe database**: Keep all your glass recipes accessible while working

### Shopping Lists Feature
- **Store-specific lists**: Organize shopping by vendor so nothing gets forgotten
- **Reorder reminders**: Flag items running low so you remember to restock

## Content Strategy Notes

- Use specific, concrete examples rather than generic "manage inventory" language
- Focus on solving real studio workflow problems
- Emphasize time-saving and organization benefits
- Show how features connect (e.g., looking up glass → seeing past projects → deciding to reorder)
